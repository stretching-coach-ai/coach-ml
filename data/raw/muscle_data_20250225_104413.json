          "title": "Midterm Outcomes of Shoulder Dislocations in Brachial Plexus Birth Injuries Treated With Injection Botulinum Toxin A.",
          "abstract": "Shoulder dislocation can be seen early in infancy and can be diagnosed by shoulder ultrasound. Botulinum toxin injection in the internal rotators of the shoulder can be used to as an adjunct to relieve the internal rotation contracture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intermediate-term outcomes of shoulder dislocations treated with injection botulinum toxin and to identify the factors determining the outcomes of the procedure.Eighty-six children with ultrasound diagnosed shoulder dislocation underwent injection BTX-A between 2011 and 2022. Children who underwent nerve surgeries and the ones with inadequate follow-up were excluded. Sixty-two children were followed up for a mean duration of 36 months. Injection botulinum toxin A 2 U/kg body weight was injected each into the subscapularis and the pectoralis major. After manual stretching of contracted anterior soft tissue and shoulder capsule, a shoulder spica was applied for 3 weeks. Hospital for Sick Children Active Movement Scale (HSC-AMS) score and active and passive shoulder was recorded before and after the procedure and the requirement for further interventions was noted.Outcomes were divided into 3 categories: group A-27 (44%) children who did not require any further surgery in our follow-up period; group B-27 (44%) needed further procedure for recurrence of IR contracture; and group C-8 (12%) developed external rotation contracture later. Children in group A had statistically significant higher preinjection HSC-AMS score for elbow flexion and shoulder abduction than the other groups. Children in group C had greater passive external rotation and weak elbow extension and wrist dorsiflexion as compared with the other 2 groups.Injection botulinum toxin A is effective in treating shoulder dislocations in children with early recruitment of C5 to 6 muscles, while children with involvement of C7 muscles may develop an external rotation contracture subsequently, hence this procedure should be avoided.Level IV-therapeutic.Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

          "abstract": "Pectoralis Minor (PM) length shortening may contribute to faulty scapular. kinematics and result in shoulder pathology.of the Study: To evaluate if a prone scapular retraction exercise will demonstrate an immediate lengthening of the pectoralis minor (PM) in healthy participants.50 healthy participants were measured to determine the length of their PM. The participants then performed three sets of 10 repetitions of a prone scapular retraction exercise. Next, the participants had their PM length measured again to see if there was an immediate change in PM length.PM length was not found to significantly lengthen immediately after the prone scapular retraction exercise. The mean PM length increased by 0.243 cm after the exercise but this was less than the MDC95 of 0.63 cm so the difference does not represent a real alteration in PM length.The hypothesis was that due to the theory of reciprocal inhibition, the PM would increase in length after the exercise. This study does not support this hypothesis. This study suggests that to improve PM length the PM needs to be subjected to more time at a lengthened position than what was afforded by our exercise.This study demonstrated that three sets of 10 repetitions of a prone scapular retraction exercise did not significantly change the PM length.

          "abstract": "Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60-90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001). Conclusions The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.Copyright: © 2024 Thongchote K et al.",

          "title": "Pectoralis Major Tendon Rupture in a Spastic Hemiplegic Shoulder: A Complication of Home Stretching Pulley System.",
          "abstract": "Pectoralis major injuries are uncommon, typically affecting young male athletes engaging in high-intensity activities like weightlifting. A 62-yr-old man, who previously suffered a stroke leading to left hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and spasticity, exhibited a left chest swelling during a rehabilitation clinic visit. Subsequent inquiries revealed his recent incorporation of a home-based pulley system for stretching exercises. On examination, the swelling was diffuse, firm, and nontender, located at the midclavicular line of his left chest, with a positive dropped nipple sign and loss of the left anterior axillary fold sign. An ultrasound confirmed a low-grade injury to the left pectoralis major tendon. Spastic muscle ruptures are extremely rare, with only three published reports linked to traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Spasticity increases muscle vulnerability due to structural and mechanical changes to the skeletal muscles. This is the first report of a spastic pectoralis major tendon rupture and the first after a stroke. This case highlights the need for optimized multimodal spasticity management and reinforces the importance of comprehensive patient education on the safe execution of home-based stretching exercises.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is reported in the literature that high-volume stretching improves pectoralis muscles strength under supervised conditions while practical relevance is discussed. Therefore, the study objective was to compare the effects of volume equated, supervised- and self-administered home-based stretching on strength performance.Sixty-three recreational participants were equally assigned to either a supervised static stretching, home-based stretching, or control group. The effects of 15 min pectoralis stretching, 4 days per week for 8 weeks, were assessed on dynamic and isometric bench press strength and force development.While there was a large magnitude maximal strength increase (p < 0.001-0.023, ƞ2 = 0.118-0.351), force development remained unaffected. Dynamic maximal strength in both groups demonstrated large magnitude increases compared to the control group (p < 0.001-0.001, d = 1.227-0.905). No differences between the intervention group for maximal strength (p = 0.518-0.821, d = 0.101-0.322) could be detected.The results could potentially be attributed to stretch-induced tension (mechanical overload) with subsequent anabolic adaptations, and alternative explanatory approaches are discussed.

However, most studies investigated the plantar flexors. This study explored the effects of a static stretching program on maximal strength, hypertrophy and flexibility of the pectoralis major and compared the effects with those of traditional resistance training.Eighty-one (81) active participants were allocated to either a static stretching, strength-training or control group. Pectoralis stretching was applied 15 min/day, 4 days per week for 8 weeks, while resistance training trained 3 days per week, 5 × 12 repetitions.There was an increase in all parameters (strength: p < 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.313, muscle thickness: p < 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.157-0.264, flexibility: p < 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.316) and a time*group interaction (strength: p = 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.154, muscle thickness: p = 0.008-0.001, ƞ2 = 0.117-0.173, flexibility: p < 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.267). Post-hoc testing showed no difference between both intervention groups regarding maximal strength and muscle thickness (p = 0.905-0.983, d = 0.036-0.087), while flexibility increased in the stretching group (p = 0.001, d = 0.789).Stretching showed increases in maximal strength and hypertrophy, which were comparable with commonly used resistance training. Based on current literature, the influence of mechanical tension as the underlying mechanism is discussed. Furthermore, as equipment and comparatively long stretching durations are requested to induce meaningful strength increases in recreationally active participants, practical application seems limited to special circumstances.© 2024.

However, since the practical applicability of these long stretching durations was questioned and studies exploring the transferability to the upper body are scarce, the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using a home-based stretching program to induce significant increases in maximum strength and flexibility.

The maximum strength was tested isometrically and dynamically in the bench press (one-repetition maximum: 1RM) as well as shoulder range of motion (ROM) performing bilateral shoulder rotation with a scaled bar. Using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, the results showed high magnitude Time effects (ƞ² = 0.388-0.582, p < 0.001) and Group*Time interaction (ƞ² = 0.281-0.53, p < 0.001-0.002), with increases of 7.4 ± 5.6% in 1RM and of 9.8 ± 5.0% in ROM test in the intervention group. In the isometric testing, there was a high-magnitude Time effect (ƞ² = 0.271, p = 0.003), however, the Group*Time interaction failed to reach significance (p = 0.75).

The PM muscle regions likely respond differently to stretch, but this has never been shown in vivo. We used shear wave elastography to assess the stretch response of different PM muscle regions during shoulder abduction and external rotation in 20 healthy male participants. Participants' shoulder was passively rotated through their range of motion in 5.7° increments and shear wave velocities (SWV) were obtained for each muscle region. A piece-wise model was fitted to the SWV-joint angle data, from which slack angle, slack stiffness and elasticity coefficient were determined. For shoulder abduction, we found that the sternocostal region had a significantly smaller slack angle (p = 0.049) and greater slack stiffness (p = 0.005) than the abdominal region, but there was no difference for elasticity coefficient (p = 0.074). For external rotation, only slack stiffness was greater for the sternocostal than the abdominal region (p < 0.001) with no differences found for slack angle (p = 0.18) and elasticity coefficient (p = 0.74). However, our data indicates that neither region was slack in this condition. These findings indicate that the sternocostal and abdominal regions respond differently to passive stretch, highlighting the PM's functional differentiation.

          "abstract": "Decisions for action are accompanied by a continual processing of sensory information, sometimes resulting in a revision of the initial choice, called a change of mind (CoM). Although the motor system is tuned during the formation of a reach decision, it is unclear whether its preparatory state differs between CoM and non-CoM decisions. To test this, participants (n = 14) viewed a random-dot motion (RDM) stimulus of various coherence levels for a random viewing duration. At the onset of a mechanical perturbation that rapidly stretched the pectoralis muscle, they indicated the perceived motion direction by making a reaching movement to one of two targets. Using electromyography (EMG), we quantified the reflex gains of the pectoralis and posterior deltoid muscles. Results show that reflex gains scaled with both the coherence level and the viewing duration of the stimulus. We fit a drift diffusion model (DDM) to the behavioral choices. The decision variable (DV), derived from the DDM, correlated well with the measured reflex gain at the single-trial level. However, when matched on DV magnitude, reflex gains were significantly lower in CoM than non-CoM trials. We conclude that the internal state of the motor system, as measured by the spinal reflexes, reflects the continual deliberation on sensory evidence for action selection, including the postdecisional evidence that can lead to a change of mind.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using behavioral findings, EMG, and computational modeling, we show that not only the perceptual decision outcome but also the accumulating evidence for that outcome is continuously sent to the relevant muscles. Moreover, we show that an upcoming change of mind can be detected in the motor periphery, suggesting that a correlate of the internal decision making process is being sent along.",

          "title": "Modern Treatment of Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: Pathoanatomy, Diagnosis, and Arthroscopic Surgical Technique.",
          "abstract": "Compressive pathology in the supraclavicular and infraclavicular fossae is broadly termed \"thoracic outlet syndrome,\" with the large majority being neurogenic in nature. These are challenging conditions for patients and physicians and require robust knowledge of thoracic outlet anatomy and scapulothoracic kinematics to elucidate neurogenic versus vascular disorders. The combination of repetitive overhead activity and scapular dyskinesia leads to contracture of the scalene muscles, subclavius, and pectoralis minor, creating a chronically distalized and protracted scapular posture. This decreases the volume of the scalene triangle, costoclavicular space, and retropectoralis minor space, with resultant compression of the brachial plexus causing neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This pathologic cascade leading to neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is termed pectoralis minor syndrome when primary symptoms localize to the infraclavicular area. Making the correct diagnosis is challenging and requires the combination of complete history, physical examination, advanced imaging, and ultrasound-guided injections. Most patients improve with nonsurgical treatment incorporating pectoralis minor stretching and periscapular and postural retraining. Surgical decompression of the thoracic outlet is reserved for compliant patients who fail nonsurgical management and respond favorably to targeted injections. In addition to prior exclusively open procedures with supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and/or transaxillary approaches, new minimally invasive and targeted endoscopic techniques have been developed over the past decade. They involve the endoscopic release of the pectoralis minor tendon, with additional suprascapular nerve release, brachial plexus neurolysis, and subclavius and interscalene release depending on the preoperative work-up.© 2022 The Authors.",

          "abstract": "The anatomy of the breast must be well understood to understand the disorders that affect this organ and develop a plan for breast surgery. When examined, some degree of asymmetry is noted in most breasts. Other deformities include kyphosis, scoliosis, or some type of pectus deformity. The majority of the breast consists of glandular (milk-producing) and fatty tissues. However, the ratio of the glandular to fatty tissue varies among individuals. The breast is heavily influenced by the sex hormone estrogen. As menopause approaches, the levels of estrogen declines which also decreases the glandular tissues. The pectoralis major muscle forms the base of the breast, which extends from the second to sixth rib early in life but may extend to below the sixth rib as the breast matures and sags. The breast is anchored to the pectoralis major fascia by the Cooper ligaments. However, these ligaments are flexible and allow for movements in the breast. In most women, the Cooper ligaments become stretched with time and age, eventually resulting in a ptotic breast. Because of gravity, the lower pole of the breast is fuller than the upper pole. At the lateral edges of the breast, the tail of Spence extends in the axilla. The nipple is usually located just superior to the inframammary crease and is consistently found level along the midclavicular line and the fourth rib. Glands The underlying breast is made of glandular (milk-producing) and fatty tissue. The ratio of fat versus glandular varies depending on age, post-menopausal, post-partum, or pregnancy status. At the onset of menopause, a decline in the levels of estrogen results in a decrease in glandular tissue and an increase in fatty tissue.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

Stretch reflexes are modulated by supraspinal structures via corticofugal pathways. Neural activity in these structures is difficult to observe directly, but the characterization of reflex excitability during volitional movement can be used to study how these structures modulate reflexes and how neurological injuries impact this control, such as in spasticity after stroke. We have developed a novel protocol to quantify stretch reflex excitability during ballistic reaching. This novel method was implemented using a custom haptic device (NACT-3D) capable of applying high-velocity (270 °/s) joint perturbations in the plane of the arm while participants performed 3D reaching tasks in a large workspace. We assessed the protocol on four participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke and two control participants. Participants reached ballistically from a near to a far target, with elbow extension perturbations applied in random catch trials. Perturbations were applied before movement, during the early phase of movement, or near peak movement velocity. Preliminary results show that stretch reflexes were elicited in the stroke group in the biceps muscle during reaching, as measured by electromyographic (EMG) activity both before (pre-motion phase) and during (early motion phase) movement. Reflexive EMG was also seen in the anterior deltoid and pectoralis major in the pre-motion phase. In the control group, no reflexive EMG was seen, as expected. This newly developed methodology allows the study of stretch reflex modulation in new ways by combining multijoint movements with haptic environments and high-velocity perturbations.",

However, to date, there is no evidence on the effects of upper limb stretching training or its effect mechanism. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a comprehensive 7-week static stretching training program of the pectoralis major muscle (PMa) on glenohumeral joint ROM, muscle force, and muscle stiffness.Thirty-eight healthy, physically active participants (23 male, 15 female) were randomly assigned to either the PMa-static stretching intervention (PMa-SS) group or the control group.

Before and after the intervention period, shoulder extension ROM, muscle stiffness of the PMa (pars clavicularis), and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) peak torque (evaluated at both long (MVIClong) and short (MVICshort) muscle lengths) were investigated on a custom-made testing device at 45° shoulder abduction.In the PMa-SS group, the shoulder extension ROM (+ 6%; p < 0.01; d = 0.92) and the MVIClong (+ 11%; p = 0.01; d = 0.76) increased. However, there were no significant changes in MVICshort or in PMa muscle stiffness in the PMa-SS group.

          "abstract": "Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is a challenging condition to diagnose and treat, often precipitated by the triad of repetitive overhead activity, pectoralis minor contracture, and scapular dyskinesia. The resultant protracted scapular posture creates gradual repetitive traction injury of the suprascapular nerve via tethering at the suprascapular notch and decreases the volume of the brachial plexus cords and axillary vessels in the retropectoralis minor space. A stepwise and exhaustive diagnostic protocol is essential to exclude alternate pathologies and confirm the diagnosis of this dynamic pathologic process. Ultrasound-guided injections of local anesthetic or botulinum toxin are a key factor in confirming the diagnosis and prognosticating potential response from surgical release. In patients who fail over 6 months of supervised physical therapy aimed at correcting scapular posture and stretching of the pectoralis minor, arthroscopic surgical release is indicated.

          "abstract": "Habitual overuse of cellphones is on the rise among adolescents and young adults. Those who maintain a flexed neck posture when using a cellphone for extended periods possess an elevated risk for developing forward head posture (FHP). Chronic FHP can lead to painful medical disorders affecting the head, neck, and shoulders. Both stretching and strengthening exercises are advocated interventions to address this postural abnormality; however, due to a wide range of corrective exercise programming in the literature, the decision for which exercises to prescribe for this condition can be challenging for clinicians.For adolescents and young adults without musculoskeletal pathology, what are the most frequent stretching and strengthening exercises incorporated into effective FHP intervention programs supported by current randomized control trials?A combined total of 5 stretches and 8 strengthening exercises were identified across 3 studies of level 1b evidence that successfully impacted FHP using a combined stretching and strengthening corrective exercise intervention. The supine chin tuck and a sternocleidomastoid stretch were utilized in all 3 studies, while scapular retraction and a pectoralis stretch were included in 2 of the 3 studies.Based on the results of this appraisal, the most frequent stretches and strengthening exercises incorporated into effective FHP intervention programs supported by current randomized control trials focused on adolescents or young adults without musculoskeletal pathology include a sternocleidomastoid stretch, pectoralis stretch, the supine chin tuck, and scapular retraction.There is \"Good\" to \"Excellent\" evidence from 3 level 1b randomized control trials to support the inclusion of a sternocleidomastoid stretch, pectoralis stretch, the supine chin tuck, and scapular retraction exercises into a corrective exercise program to address forward head posture.",

          "title": "Reoperative Augmentation Mammoplasty: An Algorithm to Optimize Soft-Tissue Support, Pocket Control, and Smooth Implant Stability with Composite Reverse Inferior Muscle Sling (CRIMS) and its Technical Variations.",
          "abstract": "Reoperative augmentation mammoplasty (RAM) is a challenging procedure, with the highest rates of complications and revision. Complications include implant malposition, lateral displacement, bottoming out, and rotation. These deformities can be addressed with various procedures, but the pocket control and stability of the new smooth implant surface may present limitations.This study revisits a previously described predictable approach in primary breast augmentation and defines a surgical treatment algorithm for RAM technique selection.Between 2017 and 2021, 72 patients (144 breasts) underwent RAM with composite reverse inferior muscle sling (CRIMS) technique and its technical variations (types I-IV). CRIMS technique involves placing a silicone gel implant into the submuscular (SM) pocket with an inferior sling of the pectoralis major muscle based on the dimensions of the implant, in combination with support points/dermal bridge sutures to stabilize the implant and glandular tissue at the lower breast pole (LBP). Reasons for surgery were ptosis (92%), implant and malposition (59.6%). Patients were followed for at least 6 months in 5 cases (6.9%), at least 12 months in 50 cases (69.4%), for at least 36 months in 10 cases (13.8%), and more than 36 months in 7 cases (9.7%) (mean 34 months; range 6-48 months). Patients were evaluated in terms of resolution of symptoms, satisfaction, and complications. Three-dimensional imaging (3DI) obtained from the Divina scanner system was used and followed up for 1 year to evaluate breast position, lower pole stretch (LPS), and intermammary distance (IMD).Eleven cases of minor complications were observed in 9 patients (12.5%): hypertrophic scarring in 4 (5.5%), wound dehiscence in 4 (5.5%), Baker II/III capsular contracture in 1 (1.3%). SmoothSilk surface silicone implants were used in all cases, with an average volume decrease of 120 cc. Sixty-eight patients (94.4%) were either very satisfied/satisfied with their aesthetic result. Breast images were performed in a group of 65 patients (90.2%), and in 7 breasts (10.7%), localized oil cysts were observed. The value for LPS was 7.87% (p &lt;0.0001) between 10 days and 1 year, with the majority occurring early in the first 3 months, indicating that the LBP/implant remains steady during the last months of follow-up. No cases of fat necrosis/seroma were observed. There were no signs of intra/extracapsular ruptures, capsular contracture. There were 2 cases (3%) of minimal implant displacement and no cases of rotation.CRIMS and its variations can be performed successfully in RAM. An algorithmic approach can facilitate the pre- and intraoperative decision-making process and provide the new pocket control and implant stability with acceptable complication rates. Further accurate evaluation is recommended to understand the benefits or disadvantages of CRIMS compared to other RAM techniques.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

          "abstract": "Conflicting theories exist about the underlying cause of chronic subacromial pain in the middle-aged population. We aim to improve our understanding of kinematics and muscle activation in subacromial pain syndrome to provide insight in its pathophysiology.In a cross-sectional comparison of 40 patients with subacromial pain syndrome and 30 asymptomatic controls, three-dimensional shoulder kinematics and electromyography-based co-contraction in 10 shoulder muscles were independently recorded. Glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics were evaluated during abduction and forward flexion. Co-contraction was expressed as an activation ratio, specifying the relative agonistic and antagonistic muscle activity in each muscle.During abduction and forward flexion, the contribution of glenohumeral motion to elevation and glenohumeral external rotation was lower in subacromial pain syndrome (at 1200 abduction: -9°, 95% CI -14°- -3°; and - 8°, 95% CI -13°--3°, respectively), and was compensated by more scapulothoracic motion. The pectoralis major's activation ratio was significantly lower (Z-score: -2.657, P = 0.008) and teres major's activation ratio significantly higher (Z-score: -4.088, P < 0.001) in patients with subacromial pain syndrome compared to the control group.Reduced glenohumeral elevation and external rotation in subacromial pain syndrome coincided with less teres major antagonistic activity during elevation. These biomechanical findings provide a scientific basis for intervention studies directed at stretching exercises to reduce glenohumeral stiffness in the treatment of subacromial pain syndrome, and teres major strengthening to improve humeral head depressor function.Copyright © 2021.

Stretching is useful for maintaining and improving muscle stiffness in rehabilitation and sport practice. However, the acute and prolonged effect of stretching on the PMi muscle stiffness is unclear due to limited methodology for assessing individual muscle stiffness. Using shear wave elastography, we explored the responses of shear modulus to stretching in the PMi over time. The first experiment (n = 20) aimed to clarify the acute change in the shear modulus during stretching. The shear modulus was measured at intervals of 30 s × 10 sets. The second experiment (n = 16) aimed to observe and compare the prolonged effect of different durations of stretching on the shear modulus. Short and long stretching duration groups underwent 30s × 1 set and 30s × 10 sets, respectively. The assessments of shear modulus were conducted before, immediately after, and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-stretching. In experiment I, the shear modulus decreased immediately after a bout (30 s) of stretching (p < 0.001, change: -2.3 kPa, effect size: r = 0.72) and further decreased after 3 repetitions (i.e., 90 s) of stretching (p = 0.03, change: -1.0 kPa, effect size: r = 0.53). In experiment II, the change in the shear modulus after stretching was greater in the long duration group than in the short duration group (p = 0.013, group mean difference: -2.5 kPa, partial η2 = 0.36). The shear modulus of PMi decreased immediately after stretching, and stretching for a long duration was promising to maintain the decreased shear modulus. The acute and prolonged effects on the PMi shear modulus provide information relevant to minimum and persistent stretching time in rehabilitation and sport practice.© Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",

Clinicians should be aware of this rare condition that can appear bilaterally. In addition, the interpretation of the aberrant electrodiagnostic study results of this case was discussed.A 29-year-old male complaining of bilateral forearm tingling and upper extremity weakness visited the outpatient clinic. The symptoms began 6 mo prior, and he visited another hospital before visiting our department. The diagnosis was not made even after cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic study, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and arteriography were conducted. The patient performed unique exercises that stretched the pectoralis minor and coracobrachialis muscles. On the follow-up electrodiagnostic study, abnormal spontaneous activities in the bilateral biceps and brachialis muscles were observed. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral musculocutaneous neuropathy. Steroid pulse therapy was administered for approximately 6 wk. After treatment, his muscle strength returned to the predisease condition.Clinicians should be aware of this condition, have adequate understanding of anatomy, and advise to correct inappropriate exercises.©The Author(s) 2021.

          "abstract": "Wave surfing will debut in the next Olympic Games and is increasingly popular as a sport. Chronic shoulder complaints are frequently reported amongst surfers, though literature researching its pathophysiology and prevention is scarce. This article provides an overview of the current literature, proposes a potential pathogenesis and a potential physiotherapeutic prevention program for surf-induced shoulder complaints.A systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for articles regarding kinematic analysis of the surf paddling movement. Data sources were Embase, MEDLINE (PubMed) and Research gate. We included case series and cohort studies that originally studied or described the paddle movement made by wave surfers, studies that reported on kinesiologic analysis with nerve conduction studies and studies on 3D motion analysis of the shoulder while paddling.Eight original articles were included that analysed the shoulder movement in paddling surfers. Muscles that are active during paddling are mainly internal rotators and muscles that are involved in shoulder flexion. Internal rotators are active in propelling the surfer through the water, though external rotator strength is only used while the arm is out of the water.In surfers with shoulder complaints, external rotation range of motion and external rotation strength are impaired. Scapulothoracic dyskinesis may occur and subacromial pain syndrome may coincide. Further research should address potential pectoralis minor shortening, which may lead to aberrant scapular tilt and lateral rotation of the scapula. The surfer's shoulder is characterised by external rotation deficit, as opposed to internal rotation deficit in the thrower's shoulder, and it differs substantially from shoulder complaints in swimmers. Therefore, a specific prevention or rehabilitation protocol for surfers is required. Decreased thoracic extension may thereby alter the risk of scapular dyskinesis and hence increase the risk of impingement around the shoulder joint. A potential physiotherapeutic prevention programme should address all these aspects, with the main goal being to increase external rotator strength and to stretch the internal rotators.There is a high incidence of chronic surf-induced shoulder complaints in surfers. Symptoms may arise due to imbalanced training or scapular dyskinesis, which may subsequently trigger subacromial pain. Physiotherapeutic prevention should include stretching of the internal rotators, external rotator training and optimisation of thoracic extension and scapulothoracic movement.",

          "title": "A new model of passive muscle tissue integrating Collagen Fibers: Consequences for muscle behavior analysis.",
          "abstract": "Mechanical properties of muscle tissue are crucial in biomechanical modeling of the human body. Muscle tissue is a combination of Muscle Fibers (MFs) and connective tissue including collagen and elastin fibers. There are a lot of passive muscle models in the literature but most of them do not consider any distinction between Collagen Fibers (CFs) and MFs, or at least do not consider the mechanical effects of the CFs on the Three-Dimensional (3-D) behavior of tissue. As a consequence, unfortunately, they cannot describe the observed stress-stretch behavior in tissue in which the reinforced direction is not parallel to the MF direction. In this research, a new passive muscle model is presented, in which the CFs are separately considered in the formulation: they are distributed along the MFs in a cross-shaped arrangement. Thanks to this new architecture, a mechanical reinforced direction can be proposed, in addition to the muscle main fiber direction. The passive biomechanical properties of the genioglossus muscle of a bovine tongue have been measured under uniaxial tensile tests. To characterize the 3-D response of the tissue, tests have been performed in different directions with respect to the MF direction. Moreover, a Constitutive Law (CL) has been proposed for modeling this behavior. In addition to our measurements on the bovine genioglossus muscle, results published in the literature on experimental data from the longissimus dorsi of pigs and the chicken pectoralis muscle were used to appraise the applicability of the proposed model. It is demonstrated that the proposed passive muscle model provides an accurate description of the fiber-oriented nature of muscle tissue. Also, it has been shown that using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) it might be possible to predict the angle θ between CFs and MF.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Wooden breast (WB) is a fibrotic myopathy affecting the pectoralis major (p. major) muscle in fast-growing commercial broiler lines. Birds with WB are phenotypically detected by the palpation of a hard p. major muscle. A primary feature of WB is the fibrosis of muscle with the replacement of muscle fibers with extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen. The ability of a tissue to be pliable and stretch is associated with the organization of collagen fibrils in the connective tissue areas surrounding muscle fiber bundles (perimysium) and around individual muscle fibers (endomysium). The objective of this study was to compare the structure and organization of fibrillar collagen by using transmission electron microscopy in two fast-growing broiler lines (Lines A and B) with incidence of WB to a slower growing broiler Line C with no phenotypically detectable WB. In Line A, the collagen fibrils were tightly packed in a parallel organization, whereas in Line B, the collagen fibrils were randomly aligned. Tightly packed collagen fibrils arranged in parallel are associated with nonpliable collagen that is highly cross-linked. This will lead to a phenotypically hard p. major muscle. In Line C, the fibrillar collagen was sparse in its distribution. Furthermore, the average collagen fibril diameter and banding D-period length were altered in Line A p. major muscles affected with WB. Taken together, these data are suggestive of different fibrotic myopathies beyond just what is classified as WB in fast-growing broiler lines.",

          "abstract": "Nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate prosthetic reconstruction is routinely performed because of excellent aesthetic results and safe oncologic outcomes. Typically, subpectoral expanders are placed, but in select patients, this can lead to significant postoperative pain and animation deformity, caused by pectoralis major muscle disinsertion and stretch. Prepectoral reconstruction is a technique that eliminates dissection of the pectoralis major by placing the prosthesis completely above the muscle with complete acellular dermal matrix coverage.A single surgeon's experience with immediate prosthetic reconstruction following nipple-sparing mastectomy from 2012 to 2016 was reviewed. Patient demographics, adjuvant treatment, length and characteristics of the expansion, and incidence of complications during the tissue expander stage were compared between the partial submuscular/partial acellular dermal matrix (dual-plane) cohort and the prepectoral cohort.Fifty-one patients (84 breasts) underwent immediate prepectoral tissue expander placement, compared with 115 patients (186 breasts) undergoing immediate partial submuscular expander placement. The groups had similar comorbidities and postoperative radiation exposure. There was no significant difference in overall complication rate between the two groups (17.9 percent versus 18.8 percent; p = 0.49).Prepectoral breast reconstruction provides a safe and effective alternative to partial submuscular reconstruction, that yields comparable aesthetic results with less operative morbidity. In the authors' experience, the incidence of acute and chronic postoperative pain and animation deformity is significantly lower following prepectoral breast reconstruction. This technique is now considered for all patients who are safe oncologic candidates and are undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy and prosthetic reconstruction.Therapeutic, III.",

Traditional photoelastic-based formalism for extracting the linear birefringence (LB) properties of stretched anisotropic optical samples ignores the effects of the other optical properties of the sample. By contrast, in the formalism proposed in this study, the LB, linear dichroism (LD), circular birefringence (CB), circular dichroism (CD), and depolarization (Dep) properties are fully decoupled. Simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the two formalisms in extracting the LB properties of optically anisotropic samples with different degrees of Dep, CB, LD, and CD. The practical feasibility of the proposed all-parameter decoupled formalism is then demonstrated using chicken breast muscle tissue. In general, the results show that both formalisms provide a reliable LB measurement performance for healthy chicken breast tissue under stretching. However, while the LB-only formalism has good robustness toward scattering, its measurement performance is seriously degraded for samples with high CB.

Therefore, this study is proposed to assess the effects on pectoralis minor's length and acromial distance after active scapular retraction in scaption at 60° elevation. Sixty right-hand-dominant participants (11 males, 49 females) were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group performed pectoralis minor muscle stretching by active scapular retraction, while the control group were asked to sit in an upright position. The result shows that, the mean lengths of pectoralis minor in the intervention group were significantly increased when compared with those of the control group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.014 respectively). Simultaneously, the reduction in acromial distance of this intervention group was substantially greater than the control group's (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001 respectively).

          "abstract": "Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60-90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001). Conclusions The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.Copyright: © 2024 Thongchote K et al.",

          "abstract": "Pectoralis major injuries are uncommon, typically affecting young male athletes engaging in high-intensity activities like weightlifting. A 62-yr-old man, who previously suffered a stroke leading to left hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and spasticity, exhibited a left chest swelling during a rehabilitation clinic visit. Subsequent inquiries revealed his recent incorporation of a home-based pulley system for stretching exercises. On examination, the swelling was diffuse, firm, and nontender, located at the midclavicular line of his left chest, with a positive dropped nipple sign and loss of the left anterior axillary fold sign. An ultrasound confirmed a low-grade injury to the left pectoralis major tendon. Spastic muscle ruptures are extremely rare, with only three published reports linked to traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Spasticity increases muscle vulnerability due to structural and mechanical changes to the skeletal muscles. This is the first report of a spastic pectoralis major tendon rupture and the first after a stroke. This case highlights the need for optimized multimodal spasticity management and reinforces the importance of comprehensive patient education on the safe execution of home-based stretching exercises.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

          "abstract": "The anatomy of the breast must be well understood to understand the disorders that affect this organ and develop a plan for breast surgery. When examined, some degree of asymmetry is noted in most breasts. Other deformities include kyphosis, scoliosis, or some type of pectus deformity. The majority of the breast consists of glandular (milk-producing) and fatty tissues. However, the ratio of the glandular to fatty tissue varies among individuals. The breast is heavily influenced by the sex hormone estrogen. As menopause approaches, the levels of estrogen declines which also decreases the glandular tissues. The pectoralis major muscle forms the base of the breast, which extends from the second to sixth rib early in life but may extend to below the sixth rib as the breast matures and sags. The breast is anchored to the pectoralis major fascia by the Cooper ligaments. However, these ligaments are flexible and allow for movements in the breast. In most women, the Cooper ligaments become stretched with time and age, eventually resulting in a ptotic breast. Because of gravity, the lower pole of the breast is fuller than the upper pole. At the lateral edges of the breast, the tail of Spence extends in the axilla. The nipple is usually located just superior to the inframammary crease and is consistently found level along the midclavicular line and the fourth rib. Glands The underlying breast is made of glandular (milk-producing) and fatty tissue. The ratio of fat versus glandular varies depending on age, post-menopausal, post-partum, or pregnancy status. At the onset of menopause, a decline in the levels of estrogen results in a decrease in glandular tissue and an increase in fatty tissue.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

          "abstract": "Pectoralis minor (PM) tightness has been linked to pain and dysfunction of the shoulder joint secondary to anterior tilt and internal rotation of the scapula, thus causing secondary impingement of the subacromial space.To describe outcomes pertaining to nonoperative and operative treatment via surgical release of the PM tendon for pathologic PM tightness in an active population.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Over a 3-year period, a total of 46 patients were enrolled (mean age, 25.5 years; range, 18-33 years). Inclusion criteria consisted of symptomatic shoulder pain, limited range of overhead motion, inability to participate in overhead lifting activities, and examination findings consistent with scapular dysfunction secondary to a tight PM with tenderness to palpation of the PM tendon. All patients underwent a lengthy physical therapy and stretching program (mean, 11.4 months; range, 3-23 months), which was followed by serial examinations for resolution of symptoms and scapular tilt. Of the 46 patients, 6 (13%) were unable to adequately stretch the PM and underwent isolated mini-open PM release. Outcomes were assessed with scapula protraction measurements and pain scales as well as American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), and visual analog scale (VAS) scores.Forty of the 46 patients (87%) resolved the tight PM and scapular-mediated symptoms with a dedicated therapy program (pre- and posttreatment mean outcome scores: 58 and 91 [ASES], 50 and 90 [SANE], 4.9 and 0.8 [VAS]; P < .01 for all), but 6 patients were considered nonresponders (mean score, 48 [ASES], 40 [SANE], 5.9 [VAS]) and elected to have surgical PM release, with improved scores in all domains (mean score, 89 [ASES], 90.4 [SANE], 0.9 [VAS]; P < .01) at final follow-up of 26 months (range, 25-30 months). Additionally, protraction of the scapula improved from 1.2 to 0.3 cm in a mean midline measurement from the chest wall preoperatively to postoperatively ( P < .01), similar to results in nonoperative responders. No surgical complications were reported, and all patients returned to full activities.In most patients, PM tightness can be successfully treated with a nonoperative focused PM stretching program. However, in refractory and pathologically tight PM cases, this series demonstrates predictable return to function with notable improvement in shoulder symptoms after surgical release of the PM. Additional research is necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy of isolated PM treatment.",

          "abstract": "Low-risk cardiac surgery approaches zero morbidity/mortality, therefore, cosmetic issues append. Right thoracotomy has been advocated as cosmetically attractive alternative to median sternotomy. Posterolateral thoracotomy involves chest wall musculature division that contributes to postoperative pain/morbidity; access to the heart may be difficult. Longitudinal subaxillary incision and muscle-sparing thoracotomy can overcome these disadvantages and provide better visibility.Between April 2000 and April 2004 the authors performed open-heart repair from right thoracotomy in 161 patients. Diagnoses comprised perioval and sinus venosus ASDs (137), VSD (11), incomplete/intermediate AVD (8), miscellaneae (5). According to both patients' and surgeon's preference a longitudinal midaxillary incision and muscle-sparing lateral thoracotomy was utilised in 98 cases. Intracardiac repair was performed by extracorporal circulation, usual cannnulation, cardioplegia. Data of 79 ASD closures via midline sternotomy were used as controls.Sternotomy and thoracotomy groups did not differ in demographic characteristics albeit thoracotomies exhibited wider age and weight range. The skin incision could be easily stretched up by 60% providing excellent visibility/access. No mortality occurred. Phrenic nerve palsies (2), transient tetraparesis (1) fully recovered. A mitral valve replacement was necessary for valve pathology unrelated to access. No breast and/or upper limb vascular/neurologic problems were encountered.Right subaxillary muscle-sparing thoracotomy offers safe option for open-heart repair of selected anomalies. Despite the shorter skin incision subaxillary approach provides better visibility than conventional thoracotomy as mediastinal organs are closer to the operator. Intermediate cosmetic result are appealing. With no muscles divided less postoperative pain is anticipated. The authors recommend to expand the spectrum of anomalies repaired via this approach.",

          "abstract": "Upper Crossed Syndrome (UCS), described by Vladimir Janda, is characterized by postural changes involving the cervical spine and trunk, leading to biomechanical limitations and cervicoscapulobrachial pain. This study proposes a mesotherapy protocol, termed the 8:1 block, to address cervicoscapulobrachialgia by targeting the scapulae and associated musculature. The scapula, central to shoulder girdle kinematics, often exhibits dyskinesis and muscular imbalances, notably the pattern referred to as scapular upper trapping (SUT). SUT involves scapular elevation, medial rotation, and shoulder protraction, contributing to cervicobrachial pain. The protocol includes a comprehensive assessment of muscle tone changes and biomechanical considerations, highlighting the importance of the scapula in upper limb movement and posture. Key anatomical changes involve tightened upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and pectoralis minor muscles, with weakened middle trapezius and serratus anterior. The mesotherapy approach targets these imbalances through specific injection points to alleviate muscle tension and correct postural deviations. Case studies from our clinic demonstrate the protocol's effectiveness in reducing pain and restoring scapular biomechanics. Patients reported significant improvements in pain relief and functional outcomes, underscoring the clinical utility of the 8:1 block in treating cervicoscapulobrachialgia. This protocol offers a feasible, cost-effective intervention that enhances the efficacy of traditional therapeutic exercises by addressing underlying muscular and biomechanical dysfunctions. In conclusion, the 8:1 block mesotherapy protocol provides a novel approach to managing cervicoscapulobrachial pain by focusing on scapular biomechanics and muscle tension. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and refine the protocol for broader clinical application.",

          "abstract": "Mapping-out baseline physiological muscle parameters with their metabolic blueprint across multiple archetype equine breeds, will contribute to better understanding their functionality, even across species. Aims: 1) to map out and compare the baseline fiber type composition, fiber type and mean fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA, mfCSA) and metabolic blueprint of three muscles in 3 different breeds 2) to study possible associations between differences in histomorphological parameters and baseline metabolism. Methods: Muscle biopsies [m. pectoralis (PM), m. vastus lateralis (VL) and m. semitendinosus (ST)] were harvested of 7 untrained Friesians, 12 Standardbred and 4 Warmblood mares. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on the VL and PM of Friesian and Warmblood horses and the VL of Standardbreds using UHPLC/MS/MS and GC/MS. Breed effect on fiber type percentage and fCSA and mfCSA was tested with Kruskal-Wallis. Breeds were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with Bonferroni correction. Spearman correlation explored the association between the metabolic blueprint and morphometric parameters. Results: The ST was least and the VL most discriminative across breeds. In Standardbreds, a significantly higher proportion of type IIA fibers was represented in PM and VL. Friesians showed a significantly higher representation of type IIX fibers in the PM. No significant differences in fCSA were present across breeds. A significantly larger mfCSA was seen in the VL of Standardbreds. Lipid and nucleotide super pathways were significantly more upregulated in Friesians, with increased activity of short and medium-chain acylcarnitines together with increased abundance of long chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Standardbreds showed highly active xenobiotic pathways and high activity of long and very long chain acylcarnitines. Amino acid metabolism was similar across breeds, with branched and aromatic amino acid sub-pathways being highly active in Friesians. Carbohydrate, amino acid and nucleotide super pathways and carnitine metabolism showed higher activity in Warmbloods compared to Standardbreds. Conclusion: Results show important metabolic differences between equine breeds for lipid, amino acid, nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism and in that order. Mapping the metabolic profile together with morphometric parameters provides trainers, owners and researchers with crucial information to develop future strategies with respect to customized training and dietary regimens to reach full potential in optimal welfare.Copyright © 2024 Vidal Moreno de Vega, de Meeûs d’Argenteuil, Boshuizen, De Mare, Gansemans, Van Nieuwerburgh, Deforce, Goethals, De Spiegelaere, Leybaert, Verdegaal and Delesalle.",

          "abstract": "Compressive pathology in the supraclavicular and infraclavicular fossae is broadly termed \"thoracic outlet syndrome,\" with the large majority being neurogenic in nature. These are challenging conditions for patients and physicians and require robust knowledge of thoracic outlet anatomy and scapulothoracic kinematics to elucidate neurogenic versus vascular disorders. The combination of repetitive overhead activity and scapular dyskinesia leads to contracture of the scalene muscles, subclavius, and pectoralis minor, creating a chronically distalized and protracted scapular posture. This decreases the volume of the scalene triangle, costoclavicular space, and retropectoralis minor space, with resultant compression of the brachial plexus causing neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This pathologic cascade leading to neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is termed pectoralis minor syndrome when primary symptoms localize to the infraclavicular area. Making the correct diagnosis is challenging and requires the combination of complete history, physical examination, advanced imaging, and ultrasound-guided injections. Most patients improve with nonsurgical treatment incorporating pectoralis minor stretching and periscapular and postural retraining. Surgical decompression of the thoracic outlet is reserved for compliant patients who fail nonsurgical management and respond favorably to targeted injections. In addition to prior exclusively open procedures with supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and/or transaxillary approaches, new minimally invasive and targeted endoscopic techniques have been developed over the past decade. They involve the endoscopic release of the pectoralis minor tendon, with additional suprascapular nerve release, brachial plexus neurolysis, and subclavius and interscalene release depending on the preoperative work-up.© 2022 The Authors.",

A total of sixty female participants with rounded shoulder postures were recruited and randomly allocated into groups 1 and 2 (n = 30/group). Each group performed supervised PMi-M stretching; however, group 2 performed a combination of LTr-M strengthening and PMi-M stretching. The outcomes, including rounded shoulder posture and SFROM, were assessed using the pectoralis minor length test (PMLT) and universal goniometer. A repeated measure ANOVA was used to compare the differences within-group and between-group for the outcomes measures at one-week (baseline) pre-intervention, two weeks, and three -weeks post-intervention. The significance level was set at q > 2.00 and p 2.00) in the outcomes of PMLT and SFROM when comparing their post-intervention scores to the baseline scores. The between-group comparison revealed a significant and an insignificant (q < 2.00) difference in the outcomes of PMLT and SFROM, respectively when comparing their scores at the second- and third-week post-intervention. Furthermore, the effect size of the intervention suggests an advantage of group 2 over group 1 in increasing the resting length of the PMi-M only among young Saudi females.The combined effect of LTr-M strengthening and PMi-M stretching was more beneficial than PMi-M stretching alone in correcting the rounded shoulder posture among young Saudi females by increasing PMi-M resting length.

          "abstract": "Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is a challenging condition to diagnose and treat, often precipitated by the triad of repetitive overhead activity, pectoralis minor contracture, and scapular dyskinesia. The resultant protracted scapular posture creates gradual repetitive traction injury of the suprascapular nerve via tethering at the suprascapular notch and decreases the volume of the brachial plexus cords and axillary vessels in the retropectoralis minor space. A stepwise and exhaustive diagnostic protocol is essential to exclude alternate pathologies and confirm the diagnosis of this dynamic pathologic process. Ultrasound-guided injections of local anesthetic or botulinum toxin are a key factor in confirming the diagnosis and prognosticating potential response from surgical release. In patients who fail over 6 months of supervised physical therapy aimed at correcting scapular posture and stretching of the pectoralis minor, arthroscopic surgical release is indicated. We present our diagnostic algorithm and technique for arthroscopic suprascapular neurolysis, pectoralis minor release, brachial plexus neurolysis, and infraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

          "abstract": "The forward shoulder posture (FSP) results from shoulders being pulled forward by shortened anterior shoulder girdle muscles. The objective of this study was to investigate the short-term effectiveness of the reverse plank exercise on parascapular muscle thickness and forward shoulder angle (FSA) in patients with FSP. Participants were divided into the FSP and non-FSP (NFSP) groups based on the observed angle between the horizontal line of the C7 spinous process and the acromion process. All participants performed a total of five sets of reverse plank exercises at 30 s per set. FSA and muscle thickness of the pectoralis major (PM), serratus anterior (SA), upper trapezius (UT), and lower trapezius (LT) were measured before and after the reverse plank exercise. The muscle thicknesses of the SA and LT, and the FSA, were significantly increased after exercise in the FSP group (p < 0.05). Muscle thickness of the PM and UT significantly decreased after the exercise. In the NFSP group, muscle thickness of the LT was significantly increased, and muscle thickness of the PM and UT were significantly reduced after exercise (p < 0.05). Upon using between-group analysis, there were significant differences between the FSA, SA, UT, and LT groups (p < 0.05). The reverse plank exercise has the short-term benefit of correcting and preventing FSP by increasing SA and LT thickness while decreasing PM and UT thickness. We believe that the reverse plank exercise significantly improved the ability to prevent FSP in FSP-related muscles and was beneficial in achieving optimal postural alignment.",

The role that these functional lines plays in positioning the trunk and lower extremity of patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and healthy athletes during drop landing tasks remains unclear.The purpose of this study was to compare the front and back functional lines (FFL and BFL) muscle activation in patients with ACLR and healthy participants during single leg vertical drop jump (SLVDJ).Thirty-two male athletes (post-ACLR = 16, healthy = 16) participated (age = 23.3 ± 2.3 years). Superficial electromyography of FFL (adductor longus [AL], rectus abdominis [RA], pectoralis major) and BFL (vastus lateralis [VL], gluteus maximus [GMax], latissimus dorsi [LD]) was collected during the SLVDJ and compared at initial contact and maximum knee flexion between groups using t-tests and limbs using paired-samples t-tests.In the FFL, the AL (p < 0.05) and RA (p < 0.05) muscles were more active in the healthy group compared to the ACLR group at initial contact and maximum knee flexion. PM demonstrated greater activation in the healthy group only at maximum knee flexion (p < 0.05). In the BFL, the VL (p < 0.05) and GMax (p < 0.05) muscles were more active in the ACLR group, whereas the LD (p < 0.05) muscles demonstrated greater activation in the healthy group at initial contact and maximum knee flexion.

The placebo group completed the same motions as the intervention group, but with minimal pressure applied to the xiphoid process. Separate analyses of covariance were used to determine differences between groups (P < .05).Separate analyses of covariance showed that the self-mobilization group had significantly more flexion ROM, pectoralis minor length, and less forward scapular posture posttest than the placebo group. However, the difference in forward scapular posture may not be clinically significant.

          "abstract": "Morbidity of the shoulder after breast cancer is a well-known phenomenon. MRI studies have shown muscle morbidity in cervical cancer and prostate cancer. In breast cancer clinical observations and patient reports include muscle morbidity in a number of muscles acting at the shoulder. Several of these muscles lie in the field of surgery and radiotherapy. Timed interaction between muscles that stabilise the shoulder and those acting as prime movers is essential to achieve a smooth scapulohumeral rthythm during functional elevation of the arm.CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY: Seventy-four women treated for unilateral carcinoma of the breast were included in the study. All patients filled out the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). EMG activity of four muscles was recorded during scaption on the affected and unaffected side. Muscle cross sectional area and signal intensity was determined from MRI scans. The association between EMG and covariates was determined using multiple linear regression techniques.Three of the 4 muscles on the affected side demonstrated significantly less EMG activity, particularly when lowering the arm. Upper trapezius demonstrated the greatest loss in activity. Decreased activity in both upper trapezius and rhomboid were significantly associated with an increase in SPADI score and increased time since surgery. Pectoralis major and minor were significantly smaller on the affected side.Muscles affected in the long term are the muscles associated with pain and disability yet are not in the direct field of surgery or radiotherapy. Primary muscle shortening and secondary loss of muscle activity may be producing a movement disorder similar to the 'Dropped Shoulder Syndrome'. Exercise programmes should aim not only for range of movement but also for posture correction and education of potential long-term effects.",

Incidences up to 16% have been recorded, more often in male children. Clinical features are characterized by an inclined position of the head on the diseased side and a gaze directed towards the healthy side, deformities such as plagiocephaly, and various complications. In order to prevent this, it is recommended to screen all infants up to four months of age. Diagnosis is usually made through history and physical examination. CMT treatment is carried out conservatively, and the habilitation program is created individually, depending on the degree of CMT. The habilitation program includes neck stretching exercises, neck muscle strengthening exercises, motor activities that encourage a symmetrical movement pattern, adaptation to the environment, and education and support of parents or guardians to ensure a daily, intensive home program. Early treatment is one of the main prognostic factors on which the outcome and duration of treatment depend.

Available evidence recommends a combination of physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), botulinum toxin injection (BTI), and in the most severe cases, surgical release.This is a single-center, retrospective study conducted with Institutional Review Board approval. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of congenital muscular torticollis before 1 year old and persistence of symptoms past 1 year despite conservative treatment between January 1, 2005, and January 30, 2023. Patients with incomplete data, acquired torticollis, confounding diagnoses, or who did not receive a diagnosis or conservative therapy before 1 year of age were excluded.Seventy-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. The average age at diagnosis was 4.5 ± 2.5 months. Initial treatment consisted of PT for 61 patients (79.2%), stretching exercises for 11 patients (14.3%), and OT for 4 patients (5.2%). Regardless of timing, 74 patients in total (96.1%) received PT for an average of 13.3 ± 8.6 months. Conservative treatment modalities led to the resolution of symptoms for 40 patients (51.2%) and improvement of symptoms for 35 patients (45.5%). Two patients received at least 1 BTI which led to further improvement of symptoms. One patient underwent operative intervention which consisted of sternocleidomastoid release.RT is a challenging clinical entity that requires diligent multidisciplinary care.

          "abstract": "This review explores the current pediatric physiotherapy approaches for treating infants with congenital muscular torticollis (CMT). CMT is a common musculoskeletal condition characterized by an unequal position of the neck due to unilateral shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Our comprehensive literature search assessed articles published between 2014 and March 2024. The review emphasizes various pediatric physical therapy interventions, such as manual therapy, stretching, soft tissue mobilization techniques, kinesio taping, and microcurrent therapy, along with parental education. The effectiveness of these interventions was assessed in terms of improving the cervical range of motion, reducing muscle tightness, correcting head posture, and improving functional outcomes in infants with CMT. The review underlines the need for early diagnosis and prompt initiation of physiotherapy interventions in order to improve treatment outcomes and reduce long-term musculoskeletal complications associated with CMT. Future research directions are also highlighted to improve our understanding and treatment of this common pediatric condition.Copyright © 2024, Desai et al.",

          "abstract": "To detect the effect and safety of massage therapy on infants with congenital muscular torticollis.A total of 56 infants with unilateral congenital muscular torticollis were enrolled in this retrospective comparative study. The subjects were divided in two groups, namely, the control group and the massage group. The control group (n = 28) received the treatment of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) stretching, while the massage group (n = 28) received massage therapy combined with SCM stretching. The following parameters were compared: the cervical range of motion (ROM) and functional level (muscle function scale and ratio of muscle function scale scores). Complications, if any, were also recorded.Of the 56 infants, 7 infants (12.5%) underwent surgery with little functional improvement. The total effective rate of conservative treatment was 87.5%. No significance was found in terms of the surgery rate between both groups (14.29 vs. 10.71%, P = 0.693). After treatment, the ROM (including rotation and lateral flexion) and the ratio of muscle function scale scores improved significantly (P < 0.05). In the latest follow-up, the massage group showed a greater improvement in rotation and lateral flexion. However, no significant difference in the muscle function scale score ratio was found (P = 0.126). Importantly, no adverse events related to blood vessels, nerves, and SCM occurred.Providing massage therapy in infants with congenital muscular torticollis is a safe and effective method to improve the cervical range of motion and function. However, this study did not find any decrease in the surgical rate between two groups of patients despite adding such therapy.© 2023 Tang, Li, Xu, Ye, Wang, Wang, Shao, Wang and Xu.",

Twelve months after the surgery, there were no complications or recurrence observed.The etiology of CMT remains unknown to date, but recent studies suggest that early treatment of CMT produce better prognosis. The initial treatment for CMT is regular muscle stretching (physiotherapy), as well as education to the child's caregivers about the environmental changes and the child's posture. If the initial attempt fails, surgical intervention is needed.Early detection and early physiotherapy treatment will lead to minimize the risk of surgery.

The purpose of this study was to find an effective physical therapy modality to improve the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle thickness, the ratio of the SCM muscle thickness on the affected side to that on the non-affected side (A/N ratio), and head rotation in infant under 3 months of age diagnosed with CMT.A single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted. Participants were assigned in one of the 3 study groups through randomization. The treatment was performed 3 times a week for 30 minutes until the head tilt was ≤5 degrees. Group 1 was treated by handling for active or active-assist movement, group 2 was treated with passive stretching, and group 3 was treated with thermotherapy. For general characteristics, a χ2 test and 1-way analysis of variance were used. Intragroup differences were analyzed using a paired t test, and intergroup differences were analyzed using an age-adjusted analysis of covariance.After the intervention, there was no significant difference between groups in terms of SCM thickness on the affected side and A/N ratio (P > .05). Degree of head rotation on the affected side showed significant differences between groups (P < .05), with Group 2 showing significantly better results than group 1 and group 3 (P < .05, both).Passive stretching treatment was more effective than other treatments of this study for improvement in degree of head rotation in CMT infants under 3 months of age.The trial is registered at the Institutional Review Board of Sahmyook University (IRB number, 2-7001793-AB-N-012019103HR) and the Clinical Research Information Service (CRiS; registry number, KCT0004862).Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

          "abstract": "Here, we report a case in which acupuncture combined with trigger point injection was effective in a patient with chronic myofascial pain with referred pain in the masticatory muscles. The patient was a 46-year-old woman with the chief complaint of chronic persistent pain in the region of the left mandibular first molar, which had been extracted 5 months earlier. Stellate ganglion block was performed and amitriptyline administered at another hospital, but were ineffective. At her initial visit to our hospital, her primary complaint was chronic persistent pain in the region of the bilateral mandibular first molars. Several tender points were found on the masseter, temporalis, and sternocleidomastoid muscles, with bilateral referred pain. The pain score according to the visual analogue scale was 85. No significant psychological factors were found, however. Based on these findings, the diagnosis was chronic myofascial pain with referred pain in the masticatory muscles. Therefore, stretching of masticatory muscle and trigger point injection were performed. Two months later, the patient requested trigger point injections to be performed at all tender points, as the previous injections had been effective. The total volume of local anesthetic that this would require was considered to be excessive as there was a large number of tender points, however, and it was feared that a toxic reaction might occur. Therefore, acupuncture in combination with trigger point injection was selected instead. The symptoms disappeared within 9 months after commencement of this therapy, and treatment was completed within 1 year. The present results suggest that acupuncture therapy is effective when used in combination with trigger point injection.",

          "abstract": "Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent primary headache type world-wide. Chronic TTH (CTTH) of >15 headache-affected days per month for > 3 months can cause considerable pain and disability.This case series aimed to investigate whether massage therapy interventions were more effective when muscles of the anterior neck, jaw, and cranium were included.Four female clients suffering CTTH received six pre-determined massage therapy interventions, 45 minutes each, over three weeks. Case A and B (exclusion cases) received interventions addressing shoulder, posterior neck, and occiput muscles; Case C and D (inclusions cases) received interventions addressing the same areas as well as the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, temporalis, and masseter muscles.Treatment included myofascial trigger point release, neuromuscular therapy, and consideration of central sensitization mechanisms present in CTTH.Headache frequency (primary), intensity, and duration (secondary) were recorded via headache diaries for baseline measures (one week), interventions (three weeks), and a runout period (two weeks). Secondary measures also included a headache disability inventory (HDI) at baseline, intervention conclusion, and final measures. After final measures, clients received stretching education and four weeks later, a follow-up phone conversation to note subjective headache reports.All cases had headache frequency and HDI score reductions, while intensity and duration measures fluctuated. At final measures, exclusion Case A and both inclusion cases (C and D) had headache frequency reductions to below CTTH diagnostic criteria, clinically meaningful (> 16%) HDI score reductions, and subjectively reported continued improvements after study completion. Inclusion cases overall had greater decreases in headache frequency and HDI measures.Comparative results suggest there may be additional benefit in reducing headache frequency and disability with inclusion of anterior neck, jaw, and cranial muscles in treatment strategies of CTTH. However, limited sample size makes it difficult to rule out outliers or individual variables. Further investigation is recommended.Copyright© The Author(s) 2020.

Patients were accepted in a single session of manual therapy involving the cervical spine and thorax. Stretching of scalene, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, rectus abdominis, hip flexor muscles; and mobilization of first rib, cervical and thoracic spine, sacroiliac joints and thorax were applied as manual therapy program. Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck were assessed with visual analog scale. Measurements were performed before and immediately after of a 30-minute session of manual therapy. Pulmonary function testing was performed with a spirometer. Respiratory muscle strength (inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure, respectively) was measured. Respiratory muscle endurance was recorded using sustained threshold loading of 35% maximal inspiratory pressure.There were no significant changes in any pulmonary function parameters or maximal expiratory pressure following manual therapy intervention (p>0.05). However, maximal inspiratory pressure and respiratory muscle endurance improved (p<0.05). Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck reduced after treatment (p<0.05).A 30-minute single manual therapy session improved inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance but not pulmonary function and expiratory muscle strength in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Manual therapy may facilitate functional breathing and support use of primary respiratory muscles more effectively together with rapid pain reduction. The long-term effects of regular manual therapy on respiratory parameters should be investigated after surgical procedures.Copyright © 2019, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.",

          "title": "Thoracic dysfunction in whiplash associated disorders: A systematic review.",
          "abstract": "Research investigating Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) has largely focused on the cervical spine yet symptoms can be widespread. Thoracic spine pain prevalence is reported ~66%; perhaps unsurprising given the forceful stretch/eccentric loading of posterior structures of the spine, and the thoracic spine's contribution to neck mobility/function. Approximately 50% WAD patients develop chronic pain and disability resulting in high levels of societal and healthcare costs. It is time to look beyond the cervical spine to fully understand anatomical dysfunction in WAD and provide new directions for clinical practice and research.To evaluate the scope and nature of dysfunction in the thoracic region in patients with WAD.A systematic review and data synthesis was conducted according to a pre-defined, registered (PROSPERO, CRD42015026983) and published protocol. All forms of observational study were included. A sensitive topic-based search strategy was designed from inception to 1/06/16. Databases, grey literature and registers were searched using a study population terms and key words derived from scoping search. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third reviewer checked for consistency and clarity. Extracted data included summary data: sample size and characteristics, outcomes, and timescales to reflect disorder state. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were tabulated to allow enabling a semi-qualitative comparison and grouped by outcome across studies. Strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE.Thirty eight studies (n>50,000) which were conducted across a range of countries were included. Few authors responded to requests for further data (5 of 9 contacted). Results were reported in the context of overall quality and were presented for measures of pain or dysfunction and presented, where possible, according to WAD severity and time point post injury. Key findings include: 1) high prevalence of thoracic pain (>60%); higher for those with more severe presentations and in the acute stage, 2) low prevalence of chest pain (<22%), 3) evidence of thoracic outlet syndrome, with some association to and involvement of the brachial plexus, 4) muscle dysfunction in the form of heightened activity of the sternocleidomastoid or delayed onset of action of the serratus anterior, 5) high prevalence of myofascial pain and trigger points in the scalene muscles, sternocleidomastoid and mid/lower fibres of trapezius muscle (48-65%), and 6) inconclusive evidence of altered thoracic posture or mobility.Considerable evidence supports thoracic pain and dysfunction in patients with WAD, involving primarily nerves and muscles. Notwithstanding the low/very low level of evidence from this review, our findings do support a more extensive clinical evaluation of patients presenting with WAD. Additional high quality research is required to further characterise dysfunction across other structures in the thoracic region, including but not limited to the thoracic spine (mobility and posture) and thoracic muscles (stiffness, activation patterns). In turn this may inform the design of clinical trials targeting such dysfunction.",

The majority of the patients were aged between 26 and 35 years; the total age range was 14-77 years with the average of 38 years. Observed patients were subdivided into three groups. Standard therapeutic methods aimed at the temporomandibular joint were provided to the patients of the first group. The second group of the patients received therapy aimed at cervical muscles only. Complex rehabilitation was applied in the third group of patients. The most frequent method used in the evaluation of chronic musculoskeletal pain in clinical studies is the visual analogue scale (VAS).According to our results, all three groups of patients saw an improvement in pain perception, but the overall subjective remission of painful sensations in the third group took place in as many as 88 % of patients.

          "abstract": "Perturbations delivered to the upper limbs elicit reflexive responses in stretched muscle at short- (M1: 25-50 ms) and long- (M2: 50-100 ms) latencies. When presented in a simple reaction time (RT) task, the perturbation can also elicit a preprogrammed voluntary response at a latency (< 100 ms) that overlaps the M2 response. This early appearance of the voluntary response following a proprioceptive stimulus causing muscle stretch is called a triggered reaction. Recent work has demonstrated that a perturbation also elicits activity in sternocleidomastoid (SCM) over a time-course consistent with the startle response and it was, therefore, proposed that the StartReact effect underlies triggered reactions (Ravichandran et al., Exp Brain Res 230:59-69, 2013). The present work investigated whether perturbation-evoked SCM activity results from startle or postural control and whether triggered reactions can also occur in the absence of startle. In Experiment 1, participants \"compensated\" against a wrist extension perturbation. A prepulse inhibition (PPI) stimulus (known to attenuate startle) was randomly presented before the perturbation. Rather than attenuating SCM activity, the responses in SCM were advanced by the PPI stimulus. In Experiment 2, participants \"assisted\" a wrist extension perturbation. The perturbation did not reliably elicit startle but despite this, two-thirds of trials had RTs of less than 100 ms and the earliest responses began at ~ 70 ms. These findings suggest that SCM activity following a perturbation is the result of postural control and is not related to startle. Moreover, an overt startle response is not a prerequisite for the elicitation of a triggered reaction.",

Also, TG decreased the end-expiratory Vrcp (p=0.013) and the end-inspiratory Vrcp (p=0.011) variations. In addition, there was a reduction in respiratory rate (RR) (p=0.011) and minute volume (MV) (p=0.035), as well as an increase in expiratory time (Te) (p=0.026).

          "abstract": "To compare the short-term efficacy of 2 dosages of stretching treatment on the clinical outcomes in infants with congenital muscular torticollis.This was a prospective randomized controlled study. Fifty infants with congenital muscular torticollis who were randomly assigned to 100-times stretching group and 50-times stretching group received stretching treatment for the affected sternocleidomastoid muscle. The outcomes including the head tilt, the cervical passive range of motion, and the muscle function of cervical lateral flexors determined by the muscle function scale were assessed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. The sternocleidomastoid muscle growth analyzed by the thickness ratio of sternocleidomastoid muscles was measured using ultrasonography at baseline and 8 weeks after treatment.Except the ratio of muscle function scale scores, the postintervention outcomes were all significantly improved in both groups compared with baseline (P < 0.05). The 100-times stretching group showed greater improvement compared with 50-times stretching group in head tilt and cervical passive range of motion at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment (P < 0.05).Stretching treatment of 2 dosages may effectively improve head tilt, cervical passive range of motion, and sternocleidomastoid muscle growth in infants with congenital muscular torticollis. The stretching treatment of 100 times per day is likely to associate with greater improvement in head tilt and cervical passive range of motion.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate how the anisotropy and the static stretch stress of the cervical musculature influence the measured shear modulus in a tissue-mimicking phantom and in cervical lymph nodes in vivo by using shear wave elastography (SWE).SWE was performed on a phantom using a pig muscle and on the middle jugular cervical lymph nodes in six volunteers. Tissue elasticity was quantified using the shear modulus and a supersonic shear wave imaging technique. For the phantom study, first, the optimal depth for measurement was determined, and then, SWE was performed in parallel and perpendicular to the muscle fiber orientation with and without strain stress. For the in vivo study, SWE was performed on the cervical lymph nodes in parallel and perpendicular to the sternocleidomastoid muscle fiber direction with and without neck stretching. The mean values of the shear modulus (meanSM) were then analyzed.In the phantom study, the measured depth significantly influenced the meanSM with a sharp decrease at the depth of 1.5 cm (P<0.001). Strain stress increased the meanSM, irrespective of the muscle fiber orientation (P<0.001). In the in vivo study, the meanSM values obtained in parallel to the muscle fiber orientation were greater than those obtained perpendicular to the fiber orientation, irrespective of the stretch stress (P<0.001).

[Subjects] A total of 102 patients with CMT under the age of 6 months were studied. [Methods] Asymmety was evaluated by determining the difference in the thicknesses of the two sternocleidomastoid muscles (DTSM) using ultrasonography, head tilt (HT) based on a physical examination, and the torticollis overall assessment (TOA). Patients received ultrasound and massage therapy for 30 minutes, in conjunction with passive stretching exercises, 3 times a week. [Results] The DTSM, HT, and TOA scores were significantly different after treatment. Pretest DTSM, HT, and TOA scores and pre-posttest change scores for DTSM, HT, and TOA scores were correlated with treatment duration in infants with CMT. [Conclusion] The findings of this study suggest that treatment duration is correlated with asymmetry evaluation parameters (DTSM, HT, and TOA) in infants with CMT. We propose that these results will help in reducing the treatment duration, and also in improving communication between doctors and therapists during the diagnosis and evaluation of torticollis.",

The control group comprised specimens collected from 30 people who died of non-traumatic causes. The structures under study were examined macro- and microscopically. The basic change which could be recognized as a marker of intravitality of hanging was the presence of a macroscopically extensive blotchy area of abundant ecchymosis in the proximal muscle attachment, similar to that found in the distal attachment, and the presence of abundant diffuse intraosseous ecchymoses in the mastoid process.None of the cases revealed any ecchymoses in the proximal attachment of the muscle that would be similar to those present in the distal attachment. Discolourations within the mastoid processes, macroscopically suggestive of extensive intraosseous effusions arising from the mechanism of stretching, were not confirmed by microscopic evaluation and occurred at the same frequency as in the control group. Limitations of the study were related to the method which involved sample collection by means of bone chisels, decalcification and preparation of specimens, which had an effect, for example, on the measurable evaluation of the degree of congestion.The study has failed to provide convincing and unambiguous data on the usefulness of examining mastoid processes and proximal attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscles during autopsy to determine the presence of intravitality features of hanging.

The onset of the short-latency stretch reflex of the FIB was significantly later in the injured side of the FAI individuals when compared to the control group (P=0.009). Both the short and long latency reflex amplitude was significantly smaller in the FIB muscle in the FAI group than in the control group (P .05).

A review of the different treatment options in neglected adult cases of congenital torticollis is presented, and a case successfully treated by SCM bipolar release is reported. A 35-year-old woman diagnosed with congenital torticollis was referred to the authors' department. She had been diagnosed at 32 years of age and had been conservatively treated, with no success. Physical examination showed a posterior region of the left SCM muscle hard to palpation, with head tilt to the same side and chin deviation to the right. Bipolar release of the SCM muscle was performed under general anesthesia using the harmonic scalpel. Immobilization with a brace was applied during the first 2 weeks and manual stretching was performed after removal of the brace. Head tilt and movement limitation were resolved, achieving good functional and cosmetic results. Although the best treatment results in congenital torticollis are achieved during the first years of childhood, bipolar release of the SCM muscle followed by postsurgical physical therapy can be effective in neglected adult cases.Copyright © 2014 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine feasibility of a clinical trial to measure the effects of manual therapy on sternocleidomastoid active trigger points (TrPs) in patients with cervicogenic headache (CeH).Twenty patients, 7 males and 13 females (mean ± SD age, 39 ± 13 years), with a clinical diagnosis of CeH and active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group received TrP therapy (manual pressure applied to taut bands and passive stretching), and the other group received simulated TrP therapy (after TrP localization no additional pressure was added, and inclusion of longitudinal stroking but no additional stretching). The primary outcome was headache intensity (numeric pain scale) based on the headaches experienced in the preceding week. Secondary outcomes included neck pain intensity, cervical range of motion (CROM), pressure pain thresholds (PPT) over the upper cervical spine joints and deep cervical flexors motor performance. Outcomes were captured at baseline and 1 week after the treatment.Patients receiving TrP therapy showed greater reduction in headache and neck pain intensity than those receiving the simulation (P 0.84).This study provides preliminary evidence that a trial of this nature is feasible. The preliminary findings show that manual therapy targeted to active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle may be effective for reducing headache and neck pain intensity and increasing motor performance of the deep cervical flexors, PPT, and active CROM in individuals with CeH showing active TrPs in this muscle. Studies including greater sample sizes and examining long-term effects are needed.Copyright © 2013 National University of Health Sciences. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Long-latency responses elicited by postural perturbation are modulated by how a subject is instructed to respond to the perturbation, yet the neural pathways responsible for this modulation remain unclear. The goal of this study was to determine whether instruction-dependent modulation is associated with activity in brainstem pathways contributing to startle. Our hypothesis was that elbow perturbations can evoked startle, indicated by activity in the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). Perturbation responses were compared to those elicited by a loud acoustic stimulus, known to elicit startle. Postural perturbations and startling acoustic stimuli both evoked SCM activity, but only when a ballistic elbow extension movement was planned. Both stimuli triggered SCM activity with the same probability. When SCM activity was present, there was an associated early onset of triceps electromyographic (EMG), as required for the planned movement. This early EMG onset occurred at a time often attributed to long-latency stretch reflexes (75-100 ms). The nature of the perturbation-triggered EMG (excitatory or inhibitory) was independent of the perturbation direction (flexion or extension) indicating that it was not a feedback response appropriate for returning the limb to its original position. The net EMG response to perturbations delivered after a movement had been planned could be explained as the sum of a stretch reflex opposing the perturbation and a startle-evoked response associated with the prepared movement. These results demonstrate that rapid perturbations can trigger early release of a planned ballistic movement, and that this release is associated with activity in the brainstem pathways contributing to startle reflexes.",

The duration and total number of stretching exercise sessions were reviewed with reference to the thickness of the SCM.Among the 52 children with CMT, 46 children were successfully managed with only stretching exercise of the SCM for 1-6 weeks (group 1: 88.5%) and 6 children were managed with botulinum toxin A injection, surgical release or both in addition to stretching exercise (group 2: 11.5%). The difference in the SCM thickness between the affected and normal sides was significantly greater in group 2 than that in group 1 (p=0.026). A strong correlation was found between the total duration of stretching exercise and the difference in the SCM thickness in group 1 (Pearson' γ=0.429; p=0.003).Children with a thicker SCM seem to require a longer duration of stretching exercise and other therapeutic interventions in addition to stretching exercise for CMT.

Adult MPS subjects are often treated using fixed orthodontic therapy for resolution of malocclusion. There is no clarity in the literature on the prognosis of MPS during orthodontic therapy. The purpose of this study was to analyze the prognosis of MPS during orthodontic treatment of subjects with malocclusion, initially diagnosed as having MPS. The analysis covered the medical records of 91 young adult Caucasians scheduled for orthodontic treatment for various malocclusions. Thirty-seven of the patients were initially diagnosed as also having MPS (T0). Thirty patients began the orthodontic treatment and were recalled for a re-evaluation of MPS after dental alignment and dental class correction was achieved (T1). A wait-and-see strategy was applied in seven subjects who were included as the control subjects. They received no treatment for MPS. At T1, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the study group in the presence of any clicking or creaking noises from the jaw joint, a significant jaw joint and jaw muscle pain reduction, and a quality of life improvement. Among patients who were depressed at the beginning of treatment, the majority felt better at the follow-up evaluation. On muscular palpation, a statistically significant decrease was found on the visual analogic scale value of the middle fibers of the temporalis muscle, temporalis tendon, clavicular and sternal division of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, masseter muscles, and posterior cervical muscles. The temporalis and the masseter muscles showed a significant decrease in the number of subjects with trigger points (TrPs) in all areas in the study group, after treatment. The digastric and sternocleidomastoid muscles also showed a significant reduction in the number of subjects with TrPs. Subjects with MPS and malocclusion were treated using a fixed orthodontic treatment. They showed improvement, although no resolution, in the signs and symptoms of MPS, compared with the untreated control group.",

Clinical outcome of CMT depends mainly on the patient's age, which is also associated with the severity of fibrosis as determined by US. However, there has been no well-designed study to elucidate the true relationship among these factors nor a definite consensus on treatment of young infants with severe fibrosis in the SCM compared with well-documented reports that late cases require surgery.The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether severity of SCM fibrosis on US is correlated with clinical severity and outcome of standardized physiotherapy in early presenting CMT.Fifty patients with a palpable neck mass, initial deficit of passive neck rotation (ΔROT) more than 10°, and age less than 3 months were classified into 4 US types according to the severity of fibrosis in the SCM and underwent standardized physiotherapy and regular assessment. Relationship between US types and 2 variables (ΔROT and treatment duration) and success rate of physiotherapy was assessed.None of the cases was classified as type 4. Type 3 showed greatest ΔROT and longest mean treatment duration. Both variables showed a significant linear trend of association with US types by P for trend (P = .003, P < .001, respectively). Treatment was \"successful\" in 49 patients (98%).In young infants with CMT, US can document severity; and an early and adequate physiotherapy is a good treatment option, particularly even in those with severe fibrosis.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical features are characterized by an inclined position of the head on the diseased side and a gaze directed towards the healthy side, deformities such as plagiocephaly, and various complications. In order to prevent this, it is recommended to screen all infants up to four months of age. Diagnosis is usually made through history and physical examination. CMT treatment is carried out conservatively, and the habilitation program is created individually, depending on the degree of CMT. The habilitation program includes neck stretching exercises, neck muscle strengthening exercises, motor activities that encourage a symmetrical movement pattern, adaptation to the environment, and education and support of parents or guardians to ensure a daily, intensive home program. Early treatment is one of the main prognostic factors on which the outcome and duration of treatment depend.

Our comprehensive literature search assessed articles published between 2014 and March 2024. The review emphasizes various pediatric physical therapy interventions, such as manual therapy, stretching, soft tissue mobilization techniques, kinesio taping, and microcurrent therapy, along with parental education. The effectiveness of these interventions was assessed in terms of improving the cervical range of motion, reducing muscle tightness, correcting head posture, and improving functional outcomes in infants with CMT. The review underlines the need for early diagnosis and prompt initiation of physiotherapy interventions in order to improve treatment outcomes and reduce long-term musculoskeletal complications associated with CMT. Future research directions are also highlighted to improve our understanding and treatment of this common pediatric condition.Copyright © 2024, Desai et al.",

          "title": "Radical Neck Dissection",
          "abstract": "The history of neck dissection for head and neck cancer stretches back nearly two centuries. Even in the early 19th century, physicians were aware of the poor prognosis of cervical metastases in head and neck cancer. Other surgeons had advocated for the removal of the lymphatic tissue of the neck, but it was Dr. George Crile’s 1906 article that described en bloc resection of the cervical lymph nodes for a clinically positive nodal disease that is credited with the first description of the technique. The procedure removed all lymph nodes in the lateral neck (now known as levels I-V) and the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI), internal jugular vein (IJV), sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) along with several other surrounding structures, including the tail of the parotid gland. However, this procedure resulted in significant cosmetic deformity and loss of function. Over time, the procedure has been modified to reduce morbidity while maintaining oncologic efficacy. The modified radical neck dissection, which advocated for preserving at least one of the critical non-lymphatic structures (CNXI, IJV, or SCM), was proposed by Drs. Bocca and Suarez independently in the 1960s. Studies detailing the lymphatic drainage pathways of various head and neck regions further altered the classical radical neck dissection allowing for the dissection of limited lymph node basins of the neck based on tumor location. As anatomic and oncologic understanding has improved, neck dissection has become increasingly narrow in scope. Prophylactic neck dissections are also utilized for any clinically negative head and neck tumor with a greater than 15 to 20% chance of occult metastasis to the neck. In 2002, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery proposed a standardized classification system for naming the various neck dissections that are still in use today. Radical neck dissection refers to the removal of levels I-V along with the SCM, IJV, and CN XI. The modified radical neck dissection also removes levels I-V but spares at least one non-lymphatic structure (SCM, IJV, or CN XI). Selective neck dissection refers to any procedure which removes one or more levels of the neck based on patterns of cervical metastasis. Finally, an extended neck dissection refers to any neck dissection that removes additional structures of lymph nodes from areas not addressed in radical neck dissection.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

Their dysfunction creates several pathological patterns, such as thoracic outlet syndrome, decreased ventilatory capacity, and cervical pain. They are often the subject of medical approaches to diminish their tone and rehabilitative work to improve their physiological length or contractile strength.

          "abstract": "Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent primary headache type world-wide. Chronic TTH (CTTH) of >15 headache-affected days per month for > 3 months can cause considerable pain and disability.This case series aimed to investigate whether massage therapy interventions were more effective when muscles of the anterior neck, jaw, and cranium were included.Four female clients suffering CTTH received six pre-determined massage therapy interventions, 45 minutes each, over three weeks. Case A and B (exclusion cases) received interventions addressing shoulder, posterior neck, and occiput muscles; Case C and D (inclusions cases) received interventions addressing the same areas as well as the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, temporalis, and masseter muscles.Treatment included myofascial trigger point release, neuromuscular therapy, and consideration of central sensitization mechanisms present in CTTH.Headache frequency (primary), intensity, and duration (secondary) were recorded via headache diaries for baseline measures (one week), interventions (three weeks), and a runout period (two weeks). Secondary measures also included a headache disability inventory (HDI) at baseline, intervention conclusion, and final measures. After final measures, clients received stretching education and four weeks later, a follow-up phone conversation to note subjective headache reports.All cases had headache frequency and HDI score reductions, while intensity and duration measures fluctuated. At final measures, exclusion Case A and both inclusion cases (C and D) had headache frequency reductions to below CTTH diagnostic criteria, clinically meaningful (> 16%) HDI score reductions, and subjectively reported continued improvements after study completion. Inclusion cases overall had greater decreases in headache frequency and HDI measures.Comparative results suggest there may be additional benefit in reducing headache frequency and disability with inclusion of anterior neck, jaw, and cranial muscles in treatment strategies of CTTH.

Patients were accepted in a single session of manual therapy involving the cervical spine and thorax. Stretching of scalene, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, rectus abdominis, hip flexor muscles; and mobilization of first rib, cervical and thoracic spine, sacroiliac joints and thorax were applied as manual therapy program. Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck were assessed with visual analog scale. Measurements were performed before and immediately after of a 30-minute session of manual therapy. Pulmonary function testing was performed with a spirometer. Respiratory muscle strength (inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure, respectively) was measured. Respiratory muscle endurance was recorded using sustained threshold loading of 35% maximal inspiratory pressure.There were no significant changes in any pulmonary function parameters or maximal expiratory pressure following manual therapy intervention (p>0.05). However, maximal inspiratory pressure and respiratory muscle endurance improved (p<0.05). Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck reduced after treatment (p<0.05).A 30-minute single manual therapy session improved inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance but not pulmonary function and expiratory muscle strength in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Manual therapy may facilitate functional breathing and support use of primary respiratory muscles more effectively together with rapid pain reduction. The long-term effects of regular manual therapy on respiratory parameters should be investigated after surgical procedures.Copyright © 2019, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.",

          "title": "Thoracic dysfunction in whiplash associated disorders: A systematic review.",
          "abstract": "Research investigating Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) has largely focused on the cervical spine yet symptoms can be widespread. Thoracic spine pain prevalence is reported ~66%; perhaps unsurprising given the forceful stretch/eccentric loading of posterior structures of the spine, and the thoracic spine's contribution to neck mobility/function. Approximately 50% WAD patients develop chronic pain and disability resulting in high levels of societal and healthcare costs. It is time to look beyond the cervical spine to fully understand anatomical dysfunction in WAD and provide new directions for clinical practice and research.To evaluate the scope and nature of dysfunction in the thoracic region in patients with WAD.A systematic review and data synthesis was conducted according to a pre-defined, registered (PROSPERO, CRD42015026983) and published protocol. All forms of observational study were included. A sensitive topic-based search strategy was designed from inception to 1/06/16. Databases, grey literature and registers were searched using a study population terms and key words derived from scoping search. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third reviewer checked for consistency and clarity. Extracted data included summary data: sample size and characteristics, outcomes, and timescales to reflect disorder state. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were tabulated to allow enabling a semi-qualitative comparison and grouped by outcome across studies. Strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE.Thirty eight studies (n>50,000) which were conducted across a range of countries were included. Few authors responded to requests for further data (5 of 9 contacted). Results were reported in the context of overall quality and were presented for measures of pain or dysfunction and presented, where possible, according to WAD severity and time point post injury. Key findings include: 1) high prevalence of thoracic pain (>60%); higher for those with more severe presentations and in the acute stage, 2) low prevalence of chest pain (<22%), 3) evidence of thoracic outlet syndrome, with some association to and involvement of the brachial plexus, 4) muscle dysfunction in the form of heightened activity of the sternocleidomastoid or delayed onset of action of the serratus anterior, 5) high prevalence of myofascial pain and trigger points in the scalene muscles, sternocleidomastoid and mid/lower fibres of trapezius muscle (48-65%), and 6) inconclusive evidence of altered thoracic posture or mobility.Considerable evidence supports thoracic pain and dysfunction in patients with WAD, involving primarily nerves and muscles. Notwithstanding the low/very low level of evidence from this review, our findings do support a more extensive clinical evaluation of patients presenting with WAD. Additional high quality research is required to further characterise dysfunction across other structures in the thoracic region, including but not limited to the thoracic spine (mobility and posture) and thoracic muscles (stiffness, activation patterns). In turn this may inform the design of clinical trials targeting such dysfunction.",

Fifty infants with congenital muscular torticollis who were randomly assigned to 100-times stretching group and 50-times stretching group received stretching treatment for the affected sternocleidomastoid muscle. The outcomes including the head tilt, the cervical passive range of motion, and the muscle function of cervical lateral flexors determined by the muscle function scale were assessed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. The sternocleidomastoid muscle growth analyzed by the thickness ratio of sternocleidomastoid muscles was measured using ultrasonography at baseline and 8 weeks after treatment.Except the ratio of muscle function scale scores, the postintervention outcomes were all significantly improved in both groups compared with baseline (P < 0.05). The 100-times stretching group showed greater improvement compared with 50-times stretching group in head tilt and cervical passive range of motion at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment (P < 0.05).Stretching treatment of 2 dosages may effectively improve head tilt, cervical passive range of motion, and sternocleidomastoid muscle growth in infants with congenital muscular torticollis.

Tissue elasticity was quantified using the shear modulus and a supersonic shear wave imaging technique. For the phantom study, first, the optimal depth for measurement was determined, and then, SWE was performed in parallel and perpendicular to the muscle fiber orientation with and without strain stress. For the in vivo study, SWE was performed on the cervical lymph nodes in parallel and perpendicular to the sternocleidomastoid muscle fiber direction with and without neck stretching. The mean values of the shear modulus (meanSM) were then analyzed.In the phantom study, the measured depth significantly influenced the meanSM with a sharp decrease at the depth of 1.5 cm (P<0.001). Strain stress increased the meanSM, irrespective of the muscle fiber orientation (P<0.001). In the in vivo study, the meanSM values obtained in parallel to the muscle fiber orientation were greater than those obtained perpendicular to the fiber orientation, irrespective of the stretch stress (P<0.001). However, meanSM was affected significantly by the stretch stress parallel to the muscle fiber orientation (P<0.001).The anisotropic nature of the cervical musculature and the applied stretch stress explain the variability of the SWE measurements and should be identified before applying SWE for the interpretation of the measured shear modulus values.",

She noticed the head tilt when he was about 7 months old and abnormal alignment of the right eye when the boy was 18 months old. At 15 months when he took his first steps, his head tilt became worse. At 21 months old, a neurological and orthopedic examination at the regional university children`s hospital ruled out presence of a tumor of the cervical spine or posterior fossa. The orthopedist sent the baby for chiropractic evaluation and treatment. Chiropractic exam found decreased active and passive range of motion in the cervical spine and no evidence of mass or contracture of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Segmental palpation showed a decreased joint play and pain reaction at level C1/C2 on the right.The chiropractic treatment consisted of spinal manipulative therapy of the cervical spine in addition to massage and stretching of the neck muscles. Within a period of 4 weeks (3 chiropractic treatments) the torticollis was nearly resolved and the abnormal fixation of the right eye was no longer apparent. No relapse of the symptomatology was observed at a follow-up consultation at 26 months.The patient responded favorably to chiropractic care, showing a possible mechanical spinal cause for his torticollis and for the secondarily developed abnormal fixation of the right eye.",

The basic change which could be recognized as a marker of intravitality of hanging was the presence of a macroscopically extensive blotchy area of abundant ecchymosis in the proximal muscle attachment, similar to that found in the distal attachment, and the presence of abundant diffuse intraosseous ecchymoses in the mastoid process.None of the cases revealed any ecchymoses in the proximal attachment of the muscle that would be similar to those present in the distal attachment.

          "abstract": "Congenital torticollis is characterized by shortening and fibrosis of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle detected at birth or shortly after birth. This leads to a lateral inclination of the head to the ipsilateral shoulder and chin deviation to the opposite side. When diagnosed early, most cases can be conservatively managed with excellent results. In neglected adult cases, the treatment of this entity is more controversial. A review of the different treatment options in neglected adult cases of congenital torticollis is presented, and a case successfully treated by SCM bipolar release is reported. A 35-year-old woman diagnosed with congenital torticollis was referred to the authors' department. She had been diagnosed at 32 years of age and had been conservatively treated, with no success. Physical examination showed a posterior region of the left SCM muscle hard to palpation, with head tilt to the same side and chin deviation to the right. Bipolar release of the SCM muscle was performed under general anesthesia using the harmonic scalpel. Immobilization with a brace was applied during the first 2 weeks and manual stretching was performed after removal of the brace. Head tilt and movement limitation were resolved, achieving good functional and cosmetic results. Although the best treatment results in congenital torticollis are achieved during the first years of childhood, bipolar release of the SCM muscle followed by postsurgical physical therapy can be effective in neglected adult cases.Copyright © 2014 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine feasibility of a clinical trial to measure the effects of manual therapy on sternocleidomastoid active trigger points (TrPs) in patients with cervicogenic headache (CeH).Twenty patients, 7 males and 13 females (mean ± SD age, 39 ± 13 years), with a clinical diagnosis of CeH and active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group received TrP therapy (manual pressure applied to taut bands and passive stretching), and the other group received simulated TrP therapy (after TrP localization no additional pressure was added, and inclusion of longitudinal stroking but no additional stretching). The primary outcome was headache intensity (numeric pain scale) based on the headaches experienced in the preceding week. Secondary outcomes included neck pain intensity, cervical range of motion (CROM), pressure pain thresholds (PPT) over the upper cervical spine joints and deep cervical flexors motor performance. Outcomes were captured at baseline and 1 week after the treatment.Patients receiving TrP therapy showed greater reduction in headache and neck pain intensity than those receiving the simulation (P 0.84).This study provides preliminary evidence that a trial of this nature is feasible. The preliminary findings show that manual therapy targeted to active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle may be effective for reducing headache and neck pain intensity and increasing motor performance of the deep cervical flexors, PPT, and active CROM in individuals with CeH showing active TrPs in this muscle. Studies including greater sample sizes and examining long-term effects are needed.Copyright © 2013 National University of Health Sciences. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Adult MPS subjects are often treated using fixed orthodontic therapy for resolution of malocclusion. There is no clarity in the literature on the prognosis of MPS during orthodontic therapy. The purpose of this study was to analyze the prognosis of MPS during orthodontic treatment of subjects with malocclusion, initially diagnosed as having MPS. The analysis covered the medical records of 91 young adult Caucasians scheduled for orthodontic treatment for various malocclusions. Thirty-seven of the patients were initially diagnosed as also having MPS (T0). Thirty patients began the orthodontic treatment and were recalled for a re-evaluation of MPS after dental alignment and dental class correction was achieved (T1). A wait-and-see strategy was applied in seven subjects who were included as the control subjects. They received no treatment for MPS. At T1, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the study group in the presence of any clicking or creaking noises from the jaw joint, a significant jaw joint and jaw muscle pain reduction, and a quality of life improvement. Among patients who were depressed at the beginning of treatment, the majority felt better at the follow-up evaluation. On muscular palpation, a statistically significant decrease was found on the visual analogic scale value of the middle fibers of the temporalis muscle, temporalis tendon, clavicular and sternal division of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, masseter muscles, and posterior cervical muscles. The temporalis and the masseter muscles showed a significant decrease in the number of subjects with trigger points (TrPs) in all areas in the study group, after treatment. The digastric and sternocleidomastoid muscles also showed a significant reduction in the number of subjects with TrPs. Subjects with MPS and malocclusion were treated using a fixed orthodontic treatment. They showed improvement, although no resolution, in the signs and symptoms of MPS, compared with the untreated control group.",

          "abstract": "It has been reported that ultrasonography (US) can detect the severity of congenital muscular torticollis (CMT), and severe fibrosis of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle noted on US is irreversible and likely to require surgery. Clinical outcome of CMT depends mainly on the patient's age, which is also associated with the severity of fibrosis as determined by US. However, there has been no well-designed study to elucidate the true relationship among these factors nor a definite consensus on treatment of young infants with severe fibrosis in the SCM compared with well-documented reports that late cases require surgery.The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether severity of SCM fibrosis on US is correlated with clinical severity and outcome of standardized physiotherapy in early presenting CMT.Fifty patients with a palpable neck mass, initial deficit of passive neck rotation (ΔROT) more than 10°, and age less than 3 months were classified into 4 US types according to the severity of fibrosis in the SCM and underwent standardized physiotherapy and regular assessment. Relationship between US types and 2 variables (ΔROT and treatment duration) and success rate of physiotherapy was assessed.None of the cases was classified as type 4. Type 3 showed greatest ΔROT and longest mean treatment duration. Both variables showed a significant linear trend of association with US types by P for trend (P = .003, P < .001, respectively). Treatment was \"successful\" in 49 patients (98%).In young infants with CMT, US can document severity; and an early and adequate physiotherapy is a good treatment option, particularly even in those with severe fibrosis.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We observe miofibrosis of sternocleidomastoid muscle. This face deformation is seen from 0.3 to 1.5% children. Torticollis could be associated with malocclusion, facial asymmetry, vision defect or vertebral body deformation. Muscle stretching is a main type of treatment at infantile age. In the case of faille and in older children sternocleidomastoid myotomy is indicated. The purpose of our study is to analyze facial asymmetry in children after torticollis surgery and determination if surgery performed after 3 years of age is associated with higher risk of facial deformity in long follow up. The study population consisted of 16 patients who underwent sternocleidomastoid tenotomy in proximal and distal part. The control group consisted of 13 persons. Booth groups underwent subjective and objective analysis consisted of computer facial symmetry analysis and measurements of range of motion in the cervical spine. The study group was divided into two subgroups--patients operated before and after 3 years of age. The follow up was 2 to 26 years (mean 13.4 years). The statistical analysis of objective evaluation revealed significant difference in horizontal face axis between subgroups (p<0.05). Range of motion at cervical vertebral column was the same in both groups. Facial asymmetry caused by muscle torticollis is persistent in horizontal axis in long follow up and is more often observed in children operated after 3 years of age, but statistical analysis does not support this thesis.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that individuals with WAD display decreased postural stability during standing and walking tasks. However, their ability to maintain seated upright posture has never been investigated. The objective of this study was to characterize kinematic and electromyographic postural stabilization patterns in individuals with chronic WAD and to compare these patterns with those in an able-bodied control group. Ten individuals with WAD and an age- and gender-matched group of healthy individuals were exposed to sudden forward and backward support surface translations while they were seated. Neck and trunk muscle activity and angular displacements as well as centers of mass (COMs) linear displacements at four levels of the head and trunk were computed. The displacement onset of the combined head, arms and trunk COM was significantly delayed in persons with WAD. However, their peak trunk angles were smaller and were reached sooner. In the WAD group, the activation onset of the lumbar erector spinae was less affected by perturbation direction and the sternocleidomastoid muscle, a neck flexor, showed a trend towards being activated later, compared to the healthy group. These results suggest that individuals with WAD may alter stretch reflex threshold and/or elicit a learned response for pain avoidance that may be direction-specific. Such findings highlight the importance of assessing both spatial and temporal characteristics across different levels of the spinal musculoskeletal system to evaluate multidirectional postural responses in WAD individuals.",

          "abstract": "A biomechanical neck model combined with subject-specific kinematic and electromyographic data were used to calculate neck muscle strains during whiplash.To calculate the musculotendon and fascicle strains during whiplash and to compare these strains to published muscle injury thresholds.Previous work has shown potentially injurious musculotendon strains in sternocleidomastoid (SCM) during whiplash, but neither the musculotendon strains in posterior cervical muscles nor the fascicle strains in either muscle group have been examined.Experimental human subject data from rear-end automobile impacts were integrated with a biomechanical model of the neck musculoskeletal system. Subject-specific head kinematic data were imposed on the model, and neck musculotendon and fascicle strains and strain rates were computed. Electromyographic data from the sternocleidomastoid and the posterior cervical muscles were compared with strain data to determine which muscles were being eccentrically contracted.SCM experienced lengthening during the retraction phase of head/neck kinematics, whereas the posterior muscles (splenius capitis [SPL], semispinalis capitis [SEMI], and trapezius [TRAP]) lengthened during the rebound phase. Peak SCM fascicle lengthening strains averaged (+/-SD) 4% (+/-3%) for the subvolumes attached to the mastoid process and 7% (+/-5%) for the subvolume attached to the occiput. Posteriorly, peak fascicle strains were 21% (+/-14%) for SPL, 18% (+/-16%) for SEMI, and 5% (+/-4%) for TRAP, with SPL strains significantly greater than calculated in SCM or TRAP. Fascicle strains were, on average, 1.2 to 2.3 times greater than musculotendon strains. SCM and posterior muscle activity occurred during intervals of muscle fascicle lengthening.The cervical muscle strains induced during a rear-end impact exceed the previously-reported injury threshold for a single stretch of active muscle. Further, the larger strains experienced by extensor muscles are consistent with clinical reports of pain primarily in the posterior cervical region following rear-end impacts.",

          "abstract": "The authors conducted a scanographic study in order to characterize the local anesthetic spread of injectate resulting from a single-injection technique of deep cervical plexus block.Six consecutive American Society of Anesthesiologists II and III patients scheduled for elective carotid endarterectomy under regional anesthesia were enrolled. Deep cervical plexus block was placed via an anterolateral approach using a nerve stimulator to guide the injection on contact with the levator scapulae nerve. With specific contractions evoked at a stimulating current intensity <or=0.5 mA, a 40-mL mixture containing local anesthetics and iopamidol was injected. Thirty minutes after the block was placed, sensory and motor neural blockade was evaluated, and a helicoidal scanner of the head-neck and upper thorax was completed. Sequential cross sections spaced at 5 mm were performed from the base of the skull down to T1. A 3-dimensional volume-rendering technique was used to characterize spread of injectate, which calculated volume.All patients completed C2-C4 dermatomal sensory blockade. None of the patients experienced anesthesia of the C8 and T1 dermatomes. The spread of injectate extended in a cephalocaudal direction from C1 to C7; its wider dimensions were systematically observed at the C3-C4 level. Fascia of the carotid sheath and sternocleidomastoid muscle limited the anterior spread of injectate. The trapezius limited lateral and posterior diffusion of injectate. Spread of injectate had a large volume exceeding twice that of the injectate. It has roughly a hemi cylinder shape with both ends stretched toward C1 and C7.The authors showed that deep cervical plexus block was associated with a wide spread of injectate. The data show that the spread of injectate is enclosed within to the prevertebral layer of the deep cervical fascia.",

          "abstract": "It has been speculated that the use of a mouthguard improves athletic ability such as muscular strength and equilibrium. The postural system is equipped with response patterns that correct for unexpected perturbations. These responses are driven by immediate feedback from visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information. These are integrated by the central nervous system. We analysed the possibility that wearing a mouthguard influences vestibular information via the vestibulocollic reflex (VCR) in the sagittal plane. The input of the VCR is vestibular afferent activity and its output is neck muscle activation. With the subject in the supine position, the apparatus used in this study induces the VCR by subjecting the head to abrupt vertical acceleration by sudden free fall under the head's own weight. Surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings in the sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM) of 14 participants were analysed. There were no significant differences in the amplitude of the VCR within the left and right SCM whether subjects were or were not wearing a mouthguard (P=0.3227 within left SCM; P=0.9686 within right SCM). These results suggest that wearing a mouthguard has no effect on the VCR in the sagittal plane when supine, and so that vestibular sensory information is unaffected by wearing a mouthguard, in this context. Further research is required to examine whether this also holds true in more functional, upright and dynamic body positions.",

          "abstract": "Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) is the most common form of torticollis in children, significantly outnumbering orthopedic, neurologic, and ocular causes. CMT may present as a palpable sternomastoid tumor (SMT) or a simple tightness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), designated as idiopathic muscular torticollis (IMT). Muscular torticollis has been associated with positional plagiocephaly in neonates who slept in the supine position. We have had difficulty in treating some of these combined cases by traditional methods such as physiotherapy, stretching exercises, and molding helmets. In November 2000, we began injecting botulinum toxin type A in cases in which there was persistent IMT, despite significant physical therapy input. The 15 patients included in this retrospective study all presented with IMT and positional plagiocephaly; all had responded poorly to conservative treatment, including physiotherapy, stretching exercises, or use of a helmet. In the attempt to avoid progression to surgical release, these patients were treated with botulinum toxin injected into the affected SCM and subsequent additional physiotherapy. All appeared to respond well, and a retrospective analysis of this treatment strategy was undertaken. Information gathered included a questionnaire, skull-shape tracings, and photographs. Independent outcome assessment data were then obtained from the regional child development teams and community physiotherapists. These results show that 14 of 15 children with recalcitrant IMT and positional plagiocephaly treated with botulinum toxin obtained sufficient improvement in neck range of motion and head position as to make surgical release of the muscle unnecessary. Our conclusion is that the use of botulinum toxin is a safe and effective adjunct to physical therapy in treating recalcitrant IMT; in selected cases, it may obviate the need for surgical release of a tight but nonfibrotic SCM.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test whether anticipation of upcoming head blow stimuli, which elicit reflex responses in the neck muscle, makes the reflex responses greater or not. In nine healthy subjects the reflex responses were elicited in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle in the eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions, which corresponded to the predictable and unpredictable conditions, respectively. The subjects were instructed not to resist the perturbations after the impact. The results demonstrated that the reflex response of the SCM muscle was significantly smaller in the predictable EO condition than in the unpredictable EC condition (P < 0.05), although no significant differences were observed in either the background EMG activities or the head accelerations. Further, this effect of anticipation was observed only in the later reflex EMG component, which most probably mediated the stretch reflex pathway. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the early component, which was presumed to be the vestibular-collic reflex. The reduced stretch reflex response was suggested to be functionally relevant to the task requirement, i.e., to let the neck extension movement occur, and not to resist after the impact of the head blow. It was concluded that the anticipation has an effect on reducing the stretch reflex responses in the neck muscle, but does not have any effect on the presumed vestibular-collic reflex under the present experimental paradigm. It is suggested that the gain of the stretch reflex pathway is modulated by anticipatory information of upcoming mechanical event.",

          "abstract": "It is unclear whether reflexive muscle contraction in unaware occupants can alter spinal kinematics to mitigate injury in the unaware occupant subjected to whiplash loading. Whiplash injury likely occurs during the non-physiologic S-curvature phase of spinal kinematics, present during the first 100 msec after the initiation of T1 acceleration. Experimental investigations using human volunteers have reported 45 to 60 msec delays prior to electrical activity of the sternocleidomastoid. The effects of reflexive contraction of the neck muscles were investigated using a validated head-neck computational model consisting of head, cervical spine, and first thoracic vertebra. Intervertebral discs. spinal ligaments, and facet joints were modeled using discrete elements. Passive and active musculature were incorporated using the Hill-type muscle model. The computational model was subjected to 2.6 m/sec rear impact velocity, applied to T1. Reflexive muscle contraction in the unaware occupant model was incorporated using a 54-msec muscle delay, 13-msec electromechanical delay, and an 81-msec muscle rise time. Results of the unaware occupant model were compared to the model exercised without muscle contraction. Reflexive muscle contraction altered segmental angulations by less than 10% and facet joint capsular ligament distractions by less than 16% during the time of maximum S-curvature. At the C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels, muscle contraction increased capsular ligament distractions. Due to the nominal affect of reflexive muscle contraction on segmental angulations and facet joint capsular ligament distractions during S-curvature, it is unlikely that this contraction can alter the cervical kinematics responsible for whiplash injury.",

          "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Posterior neck, trapezius, and interscapular pain, exacerbated by poor posture such as forward head and rounded shoulders, is common. In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of isotonic saline injections at nerve entrapment points (NEPs) within the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and scalenus medius (SM) muscles for alleviating spinal accessory nerve (SAN) and dorsal scapular nerve (DSN) compression in patients suffering from posterior neck, trapezius, and interscapular pain. Methods: In this retrospective study, 68 patients were included, with 34 receiving isotonic saline injections and 34 undergoing Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) as a control. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Percent Pain Intensity Difference (PPID) before and after therapy. The effectiveness of isotonic saline injections targeting NEPs in the SCM and SM muscles in relieving pain associated with SAN and DSN entrapment was assessed. Results: Both treatments significantly reduced VAS and PPID scores, with injection therapy showing a larger treatment effect size (Cohen's d: 3.521 for VAS and 3.521 for PPID) compared to ESWT (Cohen's d: 1.379 for VAS and 1.710 for PPID). The mean clinically important difference observed for VAS was 4.2, exceeding the expected value of 2.6, indicating a substantial improvement in pain and patient quality of life. Conclusions: Isotonic saline injections at the NEPs of SAN and DSN within the SCM and SM muscles might potentially reduce posterior neck, trapezius, and interscapular pain associated with possible nerve entrapment, without causing complications. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger, controlled trials.",

The following were assessed: pain intensity on manual palpation the over spinous process of C1-C3, zygapophyseal joints of C0-C4, and trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, suboccipitalis, masseter and temporalis muscles; cervical range of motion (ROM); flexion-rotation test (FRT); forward head posture; cranio-cervical flexion test (CCFT); neck flexor and extensor endurance; pressure-pain thresholds (PPT) over neural structures and upper limb neural tests (ULNT) in addition to median UNLT + CCF. Correlation analyses were performed to assess the association between examination findings and headache intensity. Logistic regression and discriminant analyses were also performed.Forty-seven participants (26 men and 21 women; mean age = 38.9 years old) were included in the study. 60% of the participants presented with headache. Several examination findings were significantly different between groups. A group of examination findings composed of neck endurance, manual palpation over cervical and muscular structures, PPT, CCFT, ROM and FRT could discriminate between groups with a sensitivity of 86.7% and specificity of 90%.Several neuromusculoskeletal features are different between people with acute WAD with or without headache.

          "abstract": "Computer professionals often develop a forward head posture due to prolonged hours of computer use, leading to neck pain. Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), an advanced technique for treating myofascial trigger points, has become increasingly popular for addressing these musculoskeletal issues.The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of IASTM mobilization on SBAL (superficial back arm line) and SM(specific muscles-upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and sternocleidomastoid) in managing chronic neck pain among computer professionals.The study involved 62 computer professionals, randomly divided into two groups. Group A received IASTM on SBAL and group B received IASTM on SM for neck pain each receiving three sessions weekly for four weeks. Outcome variables like Neck Disability Index (NDI), NPRS(Neck Pain Rating Scale), Craniovertebral angle (CVA), and range of motion (ROM) for flexion, and side flexion (right & left side) were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.Significant improvement in NPRS were observed in both the SBAL and SM groups after 2 weeks of IASTM, wth the SBAL group demonstrating greater improvement. At 4 weeks, IASTM on SBAL showed significantly higher improvements in NPRS, CVA, NDI, and flexion compared to the SM group. The repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of both time and group, along with a significant interaction between time and group for all outcome variables, except for CVA.The study indicates that IASTM on SBAL may offer a more effective treatment for chronic neck pain in computer professionals compared to targeting specific muscles.Copyright © 2024.

This activity modulation is exaggerated in people with whiplash associated disorders (WAD), but it is unknown whether it is impacted by sitting posture.This study investigated; (i) whether activity of cervical muscles differs with spinal posture; (ii) whether the effect of eye gaze direction (horizontal/vertical) on neck muscle activity differs between postures, and (iii) whether these effects differ between individuals with and without WAD.In three seated postures (normal relaxed, head forward, sit tall) electromyography (EMG) was recorded right obliquus capitis inferior (OI), multifidus (MF), splenius capitis (SP) and left sternocleidomastoid (SCM) with fine-wire and surface electrodes in ten healthy controls and nine with WAD. Electro-oculography recorded eye movements.In controls, EMG was less for extensor muscles in Sit Tall than Head Forward, but higher in SCM. Only SC EMG modulated with eye movement. When WAD participants adopted similar sitting postures several responses were different; compared to Normal Relaxed posture OI EMG was less in Head Forward; MF EMG was less in Sit Tall; and SC was less in Head Forward and Sit Tall. Neck muscles in WAD were generally more sensitive to eye movement, except SC which did not modulate.These finding support the hypothesis that neck muscle activity is influenced by spinal posture and eye movement.

          "abstract": "Purpose: Forward head posture is identified as the flexion of the lower cervical spine along with the extension of the upper cervical spine, with an overall increase in the cervical curve. This study aimed to compare the immediate effect of upper-cervical level and cervicothoracic junction level manual therapy on head posture, cervical range of motion and muscle activity of the subjects with forward head posture.Methods: A total 22 subjects with chronic neck pain (numeric pain rating scale >3, forward head posture: cranio-vertebral angle <51°) participated in the study and were randomly allocated into the upper-cervical (n = 11) and cervicothoracic junction (n = 11) groups. Cranio-vertebral angle, cervical range of motion, and electromyography amplitude during performance of the craniocervical flexion test were measured before and immediately after the intervention.Results/findings: There were no significant main effects for the group by time outcome score of craniovertebral angle and electromyography amplitude. However, in the range of motion of the cervical area, the cervicothoracic junction group showed a significant increase in extension and right rotation than the upper-cervical group (p < 0.05). Moreover, in both groups, the electromyography amplitude of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was significantly reduced after intervention. The electromyography amplitude of the anterior scalene muscle in only the cervicothoracic junction group was significantly reduced after intervention (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Cervicothoracic junction manual therapy improved cervical alignment, cervical mobility (extension, rotation), and muscle recruitment ability in subjects with forward head posture. These observations may partially explain the efficacy of this manual therapy in rehabilitation of individuals with mechanical neck disorder (with forward head posture).Implications for rehabilitationForward head posture is identified as the flexion of the lower cervical spine along with the extension of the upper cervical spine, with an overall increase in the cervical curve.Cervicothoracic area manual therapy in subjects with neck pain and forward head posture better improved the muscle recruitment ability than upper cervical area manual therapy during motor tasks.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between head and neck posture and superficial neck flexor and extensor activity during performance of the craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) in women with migraine and healthy controls.Fifty-two women with episodic migraine, 16 with chronic migraine, and 23 healthy controls participated. Head and neck posture were determined by assessing the craniovertebral (CV) angle and cervical lordosis angle. Surface electromyography signals were recorded bilaterally from sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene, splenius capitis, and upper trapezius muscles as participants performed the CCFT. Differences in electromyogram activity and posture among groups were compared with analyses of variance. Correlations between posture and electromyogram activity were analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient.Both migraine groups had a significant increase in splenius capitis muscle activity, when acting as an antagonist, at the last stage of CCFT (F = 4.687; P = .012) compared with controls. No differences among groups were observed for head and neck posture. No significant correlation was found in the episodic migraine group. Moderate correlations between the CV angle and upper trapezius activity at the majority stages of the CCFT (-0.61 < r < -0.65, all P < .05) were observed within the chronic migraine group: the more extended the head posture, the higher the activity of the upper trapezius muscle. The CV angle also was correlated with upper trapezius muscle activity at the first stage of the CCFT and with splenius capitis muscle activity at the last stages (-0.42 < r < -0.52; P < .05).An extended (forward) head posture was moderately correlated with an increased in electrical activity of superficial neck extensor muscles, particularly the upper trapezius, when acting as an antagonist, during the performance of the CCFT in women with chronic but not episodic migraine.Copyright © 2018.

While extensive testing was conducted to confirm that the halo protects the driver from contact, the halo's effect on the driver during overtaking was not tested prior to its introduction. Here, we describe the effect of a halo-type structure on the neck muscle activity of one of the authors, a national-level amateur racing driver, during on-track simulations designed to practise overtaking. We found that the halo-type structure caused an increase in the rates of fatigue and workloads of sternocleidomastoid and cervical erector spinae. The results suggest that the driver adopted a forward and right laterally flexed head position, presumably to clear the central pillar from his visible field. This has the potential to increase compressive loading of the cervical spine and affect the ability to use visual cues during steering manoeuvres.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018.

Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging (RUSI) is a reliable method to objectively evaluate muscle thickness and function.To compare thickness of cervical muscles that control both head and neck posture between asymptomatic women with and without FHP.Seventy asymptomatic women aged between 20 and 40 years, with and without FHP (35 in each group), participated in the study. The thickness of the cervical muscles (rectus capitis posterior - RCP, oblique capitis superior - OCS, semispinalis capitis - SSC, sternocleidomastoid - SCM, and longus coli - LCo) was measured using RUSI and the data was compared between the two groups.The comparison of cervical muscle thickness between women with and without FHP revealed significant difference only with regard to the muscle thickness of the SCM muscle (mean difference: 0.7mm, 95% confidence interval of the difference: 0.14, 1.26mm, p value: 0.014). The thickness of this muscle was greater in women with FHP.Tonic contraction of the SCM muscle can lead to greater thickness of this muscle in subjects with FHP.Copyright © 2017 Associação Brasileira de Pesquisa e Pós-Graduação em Fisioterapia.

          "abstract": "To determine the influence of breathing maneuver and sitting posture on tidal volume (TV), respiratory rate (RR), and muscle activity of the inspiratory accessory muscles in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Twelve men with COPD participated in the study. Inductive respiratory plethysmography and surface electromyography were used to simultaneously measure TV, RR, and muscle activity of the inspiratory accessory muscles [the scalenus (SM), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and pectoralis major (PM) muscles] during quiet natural breathing (QB) and pursed-lips breathing (PLB) in three sitting postures: neutral position (NP), with armm support (WAS), and with arm and head support (WAHS).Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was employed.

Four loading conditions were tested: no pack; a backpack; a double pack; a modified double pack (designed with a backpack and a front pack weighing 10% and 5% of body weight, respectively). Dependent variables were neck muscle activity, forward head angle and forward head distance (the perpendicular distance from C7 to a vertical line through the tragus of the ear). Fifteen children were asked to walk at a speed of 0.8 m/s on a treadmill. The EMG activity of upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and midcervical paraspinals muscles and the forward head angle and forward head distance were all significantly higher when carrying a backpack than for the other conditions. When carrying a double pack, there was a backward head posture characterised by an increased negative forward head angle, decreased forward head distance, increased sternocleidomastoid EMG signal and decreased midcervical paraspinals EMG signal, compared to carrying no pack. When carrying a modified double pack, the forward head angle and forward head distance decreased when compared to carrying a backpack. These findings indicate that the modified double pack minimises postural deviation.",

In addition, we assess the relationship between these muscle TrPs, FHP, neck mobility, and several clinical variables concerning the intensity and the temporal profile of headache.TTH is a headache in which musculoskeletal disorders of the craniocervical region might play an important role in its pathogenesis. Design.-A blinded, controlled pilot study.Fifteen ETTH subjects and 15 matched controls without headache were studied. TrPs in both upper trapezius, both sternocleidomastoids, and both temporalis muscles were identified according to Simons and Gerwin diagnostic criteria (tenderness in a hypersensible spot within a palpable taut band, local twitch response elicited by snapping palpation, and elicited referred pain with palpation). Side-view pictures of each subject were taken in both sitting and standing positions, in order to assess FHP by measuring the craniovertebral angle. A cervical goniometer was employed to measure neck mobility. All measures were taken by a blinded assessor. A headache diary was kept for 4 weeks in order to assess headache intensity, frequency, and duration.The mean number of TrPs for each ETTH subject was 3.7 (SD: 1.3), of which 1.9 (SD: 0.9) were active, and 1.8 (SD: 0.9) were latent. Control subjects only had latent TrPs (mean: 1.5; SD: 1). TrP occurrence between the 2 groups was significantly different for active TrPs (P .05). Differences in the distribution of TrPs were significant for the right upper trapezius muscles (P= .04), the left sternocleidomastoid (P= .03), and both temporalis muscles (P < .001). Within the ETTH group, headache intensity, frequency, and duration outcomes did not differ depending on TrP activity, whether the TrP was active or latent. The craniovertebral angle was smaller, ie, there was a greater FHP, in ETTH patients than in healthy controls for both sitting and standing positions (P < .05). ETTH subjects with active TrPs in the analyzed muscles had a greater FHP than those with latent TrPs in both sitting and standing positions, though differences were only significant for certain muscles. Finally, ETTH patients also showed lesser neck mobility than healthy controls in the total range of motion as well as in half-cycles (except for cervical extension), although neck mobility did not seem to influence headache parameters.Active TrPs in the upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis muscles were more common in ETTH subjects than in healthy controls, although TrP activity was not related to any clinical variable concerning the intensity and the temporal profile of headache. ETTH patients showed greater FHP and lesser neck mobility than healthy controls, although both disorders were not correlated with headache parameters.",

          "abstract": "The cervical muscles are considered a potential site of whiplash injury, and there is a need to understand the cervical muscle response under non-conventional whiplash impact scenarios, including variable body position and impact direction. There is no data, however, on the effect of occupant position on the muscle response to frontal impacts. Therefore, the objective of the study was to measure cervical muscle response to graded right anterolateral impacts.Twenty volunteers were subjected to right anterolateral impacts of 4.3, 7.8, 10.6, and 12.8 m/s(2) acceleration with their trunk flexed forward 45 degrees and laterally flexed right or left by 45 degrees. Bilateral EMG of the sternocleidomastoids, trapezii, and splenii capitis and acceleration of the sled, torso, and head were measured.With either direction of trunk flexion at impact, the trapezius EMGs increased with increasing acceleration (p < 0.05). Time to onset of the electromyogram and time to peak electromyogram for most muscles showed a trend towards decreasing with increasing acceleration. With trunk flexion to the left, the left trapezius generated 38% of its maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) EMG, while the right trapezius generated 28% of its MVC EMG. All other muscles generated 25% or less of this measure (25% for the left splenius capitis, 8% for the right splenius capitis, 6% for the left sternocleidomastoid, and 2% for the left sterncleidomastoid). Conversely, with the trunk flexed to the right, the right trapezius generated 44% of its MVC EMG, while the left trapezius generated 31% of this value, and all other muscles generated 20% or less of their MVC EMG (20% for the left splenius capitis, 14% for the right splenius capitis, 4% for both the left and right sternocleidomastoids).When the subject sits with trunk flexed out of neutral posture at the time of anterolateral impact, the cervical muscle response is dramatically reduced compared to frontal impacts with the trunk in neutral posture. In the absence of bodily impact, the flexed trunk posture appears to produce a biomechanical response that would decrease the likelihood of cervical muscle injury in low velocity impacts.",

          "abstract": "In clinical practice, postural correction is a common treatment approach for individuals with neck and shoulder pain. As chronic static muscle use is thought to be associated with the onset of some neck and shoulder pain syndromes, it is important to understand the impact a postural correction program might have on muscle activation amplitudes in the neck and shoulder regions. Normalized surface electromyographic data were recorded from the levator scapulae, upper trapezius, supraspinatus, posterior deltoid, masseter, rhomboid major, cervical erector spinae, and sternocleidomastoid muscles of the dominant side of each of eighteen healthy subjects. Subjects performed five repetitions of each of four seated typing postures (habitual, corrected, head-forward and slouched) and four standing postures (habitual, corrected, and head-forward and slouched). Repeated-measures analysis of variance models (alpha=0.05) revealed that in sitting postural correction tended to decreased the level of muscle activation required in all muscles studied during seated computer work, however this finding was not statistically significant. Corrected posture in sitting did, however produce a statistically significant reduction in muscle activity compared to forward head posture. Corrected posture in standing required more muscle activity than habitual or forward head posture in the majority of cervicobrachial and jaw muscles, suggesting that a graduated approach to postural correction exercises might be required in order to train the muscles to appropriately withstand the requirements of the task. A surprising finding was that muscle activity levels and postural changes had the largest impact on the masseter muscle, which demonstrated activation levels in the order of 20% maximum voluntary electrical activation.",

This condition is common among women during pregnancy and the postpartum period and can significantly affect their quality of life and their return to sports activity. Unfortunately, information on the incidence, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of diastasis rectus abdominis are limited.We conducted a pilot prospective observational study on 37 patients who practiced sports at high levels (at least 3 times a week with amateur/competitive competitions) who underwent ultrasound measurements of the distance between the rectus abdominis muscles at the level of the xiphoid process, supraumbilical, umbilical, and subumbilical at time (T0), after 2 months from the rehabilitation protocol (T1), and then after 4 months of rehabilitation protocol (T2) from approximately 3 months after giving birth, and we saw an early return to sport.Our data analysis reveals that there is an initial decrease in diastasis during the first 2 months with 3 weekly physiotherapy activity sessions in all 4 measurements. One session takes place on site with physiotherapists, while the other 2 are carried out at home using the rehabilitation protocol provided by the medical staff. At the 4-month follow-up, the improvement was similar to the previous follow-up.Of the 37 women analyzed, 6 were referred to the surgeon; 2 for hernias and 4 for diastases greater than 4 cm.

Surface electromyography (EMG) was utilized to measure muscle activity at four sites: right rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), multifidus (MU), and longissimus (LO). Mean EMG activity, co-contraction indices, and duration of core muscle activation were analyzed using independent t-tests to examine the differences between groups. Cohen's d was used to calculate effect sizes based on the standard deviations of the groups. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The experienced practitioners scored significantly higher in total FMS scores and in four sub-units of the FMS scores compared to the novice group (p ≤ 0.01). Mean EO EMG activity was also significantly greater in experienced practitioners during all Pilates exercises (p < 0.05). Additionally, the RA/EO co-contraction index was higher in experienced practitioners during the 'double leg stretch' exercise (p = 0.02).The results suggest that experienced Pilates practitioners have superior functional movement abilities and greater core muscle activation, particularly in the EO muscle group, compared to novice practitioners. These findings may assist Pilates instructors in refining instructional strategies to cater to different skill levels and enhance training effectiveness.Copyright © 2024 Ko, Jung, Park, Song, Wang and Jung.",

The use of foam rollers (FR) have been purported to improve the recruitment of core muscles by creating an unstable surface, providing improvements to balance, posture and functional recovery in daily activities. However, there is a paucity of studies exploring the use of FR as an unstable surface. The aim of this study was to analyze the acute effects on the recruitment of core muscles during two Pilates exercises, a single leg stretch (SL) and single straight leg stretch (SS), on the ground and using a FR as an unstable surface. Thirty women aged between 25 and 35 years old who had not previously practiced Pilates participated in this study. Surface EMG signals were collected from rectus abdominis (RA) and external oblique (EO) muscles during an isometric contraction lasting 30 s during the exercises. Two-factor Repeated Measures ANOVA tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons were used to investigate the muscle activity between the two stretching exercises when performed on the ground and using the FR. No significant interaction effects were seen between the two exercises and positions, and no main effects were seen for either factor. These findings do not indicate the influence of the surface (ground versus FR) or exercise (SL versus SS) on the muscle activity of the rectus abdominis and external oblique muscles when considering the immediate effects.

          "abstract": "Diastasis recti (DR) is defined as the separation of the rectus muscles as a result of the linea alba thinning and stretching. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of a new technique, robotic rectus abdominis medialization (rRAM), for DR repair with a concomitant ventral hernia.Patients who underwent rRAM for repair of DR and a concomitant ventral hernia were identified between January 2015 and December 2020. The results are from a single surgeon at a single institution.A total of 40 patients were identified, 29 of which were female. The mean age was 43 years, the mean body mass index was 27 kg/m 2 , and the mean inter-rectus distance was 6 cm based on available preoperative imaging. The median postoperative length of stay was 1 day, and the median follow-up time was 1 month. Within 30 postoperative days, 3 patients were re-admitted and 5 developed complications, of which 1 required operative re-intervention for seroma. Beyond 30 days, 3 patients required operative re-intervention most commonly for persistent pain from suture material. On the basis of computed tomography scans performed at a mean of 30 months after the date of service, the mean postoperative inter-rectus distance was 1 cm; 1 patient had DR recurrence, and 1 patient developed a new incisional hernia without DR recurrence. There was no hernia recurrence.rRAM is a safe and effective technique for DR repair with a concomitant ventral hernia. Further studies are needed to determine how outcomes from this robotic approach compare with those from different robotic, laparoscopic, and open techniques.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The G values of some limb muscles were measured in relaxed and stretched positions.Regarding the effect of age on G at the distinct positions, the G of the upper limb muscles were not significantly correlated with age in the relaxed and stretched positions.

Regarding differences among body parts, the G of the lower limb and oblique abdominal muscles showed a significant negative correlation, but no correlation in the upper limb, rectus abdominis, and back muscles. Moreover, MT showed a significant negative correlation with age in the lower limb, abdominal, and erector spinae muscles, but no correlation was detected in the upper limb and lumbar multifidus muscles. EI had a significant positive correlation in all the muscles.The effect of age on G depended on body parts, and the G of the lower limb and oblique abdominal muscles negatively associated with age.

          "abstract": "Pilates is an effective exercise method for rehabilitating musculoskeletal disorders as its principles are based on the activation of local muscles. This study aimed to compare the subjects with and without Pilates experience to find out the effect of the experience on the core muscle activity and muscle co-contraction, and to examine the relationship between the core muscle activation level and the kinematic data. This study involved 32 subjects, including 16 experienced Pilates practitioners and 16 non-experienced subjects. The knee stretch on the reformer was performed in three different positions: flat back with a neutral pelvis, round back with posteriorly tilted pelvis (RPP), and extended back anteriorly tilted pelvis (EAP). The electromyography of the internal oblique (IO), rectus abdominis (RA), multifidus (MU), and iliocostalis lumborum (IL) muscles were measured, as well as kinematic data from a 3D motion analysis system. Compared to the non-experienced subjects, the experienced subjects activated the IO muscles more than the RA muscles, and the most significant difference was seen in the RPP position (p < 0.05). The experienced patients activated the MU muscles more often than the IL muscles, with the most significant difference observed in the RPP position and the least significant in the EAP position (p < 0.05). All kinematic data and muscle activity (IO, IO/RA ratio, MU/IL ratio) showed significant differences between the experienced and non-experienced subjects (p < 0.05). The subjects presented a moderate correlation between muscle activation and core stability. It was confirmed that the experienced Pilates practitioners activated the abdominal and low back core muscles effectively, and the stability of the pelvis and trunk were better than that of the non-experienced participants. In addition, the better the trunk stability was maintained, the larger and more accurate movement of the mobility segment was observed.",

The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the KT group (intervention), in which KT tapes were applied (48 h intervention) and the sham KT group (control, sham intervention), in which non-stretch tapes were used (cloth surgical tape, 48 h intervention). In all participants, a palpation assessment of RAD was conducted and the inter-recti distance was measured using a digital caliper at three sites: at the umbilicus and 4.5 cm above and below it. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention.The gathered results show a statistically significant reduction in rectus abdominis diastasis at each of the observed sites after the application of KT tapes in the intervention group (p < 0.05).

Patients were accepted in a single session of manual therapy involving the cervical spine and thorax. Stretching of scalene, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, rectus abdominis, hip flexor muscles; and mobilization of first rib, cervical and thoracic spine, sacroiliac joints and thorax were applied as manual therapy program. Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck were assessed with visual analog scale. Measurements were performed before and immediately after of a 30-minute session of manual therapy. Pulmonary function testing was performed with a spirometer. Respiratory muscle strength (inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure, respectively) was measured. Respiratory muscle endurance was recorded using sustained threshold loading of 35% maximal inspiratory pressure.There were no significant changes in any pulmonary function parameters or maximal expiratory pressure following manual therapy intervention (p>0.05). However, maximal inspiratory pressure and respiratory muscle endurance improved (p<0.05). Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck reduced after treatment (p<0.05).A 30-minute single manual therapy session improved inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance but not pulmonary function and expiratory muscle strength in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Manual therapy may facilitate functional breathing and support use of primary respiratory muscles more effectively together with rapid pain reduction. The long-term effects of regular manual therapy on respiratory parameters should be investigated after surgical procedures.Copyright © 2019, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the anatomical relation of the rectus abdominis muscles with the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths. The elastic behavior of these fascial sheets is also assessed. Both of these analyses form an anatomic-biomechanical basis for diagnosis and treatment, especially in relation to diastasis recti abdominis (DRA).Fundamental observational, biomechanical study. Seven post-mortem, embalmed human specimens were dissected. The abdominal muscles and the fascial sheets of the abdominal wall were dissected. 4 × 4 cm samples of the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths were loaded in longitudinal and transverse direction, while recording elongation by means of a displacement sensor. The main outcome measures were anatomical descriptions and elongation of fascia samples in mm (mean and standard ± deviation).In longitudinal direction the posterior rectus sheath samples stretched over 1.67 ± 0.48 mm, while in transverse direction the mean stretch was 0.29 ± 0.18 mm (p = 0.001). In contrast, no significant difference between longitudinal (0.78 ± 0.43 mm) and transversal displacement (0.50 ± 0.23 mm) was observed in the anterior rectus sheath (p = 0.56).The posterior rectus sheath is functionally more related to the transverse abdominis muscle than to the rectus abdominis muscle. From this connection, in combination with the specific stiffness of the posterior fascia in the lateral direction, it is assumed that the transverse abdominis muscles play an important role in the etiology but also in reduction of DRA. The transverse abdominis and rectus abdominis muscles collaborate in support of the abdominal wall.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

EMG of the RA and OI muscles was evaluated during the double leg stretch (DLS) exercise on three different supporting bases - mat, long box, and short box. Trunk stability varies according to the size and type of the base. To normalize the data, the RMS value (EMG) obtained during the DLS exercise was divided by the RMS value from the torque test - the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) - and multiplied by 100 (%MVIC). One-way repeated-measured analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni tests were used to compare data concerning the supporting bases and Student t-test regarding the muscles (p < 0.05).The comparison among the bases involving each muscle - RA or IO (p < 0.05) - showed significant difference (%MVIC) between the mat and the short box. No significant difference was observed between the muscles concerning the exercise on the mat (p = 0.9266), on the long box (p = 0.5113) and on the short box (p = 0.2972).The short box increased the activity of the rectus abdominis and internal oblique muscles during exercise.

The needling group received a single session of TrP-DN to trigger points (TrPs) in the rectus abdominis, and the placebo group received placebo needling. The primary outcome was pain intensity (visual analogue scale). Secondary outcomes were quality of life, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the number of days with pain, and self-perceived improvement, measured using a Global Rate of Change.

          "abstract": "Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy gradually lose the ability to use different muscles of their body. Consequently, they lose the ability to stabilize their trunk against gravity. This hinders them to effectively perform different daily activities. In this paper, we describe the design, realization and evaluation of a trunk orthosis for these patients that should allow them to move their trunk and maintain stability.This study aimed to primarily assess the effectiveness of the trunk support system in terms of unloading of trunk muscles, so only healthy participants were recruited for this phase of the study. Measurements were done on 10 healthy participants (23.4±2.07 [M±SD] years old, average body weight 68.42±24.22 [M±SD] kg). The experiment comprised maintaining a constant trunk posture in three different device conditions (control without orthosis and two conditions with different configurations of the orthosis), at four different flexion angles (10°, 20°, 30°, 40°) for each device condition and for two load conditions (with and without stretching the arms). Electromyography (EMG) signals from the trunk muscles were measured to estimate activation levels of the trunk muscles (iliocostalis, longissimus, external oblique and rectus abdominis) and a motion capture system was used to record the movement of the participants during the experiment.Wearing the orthosis caused reductions in longissimus and iliocostalis activity. The average muscle activity level was 5%-10% of maximum voluntary contraction in the unsupported conditions for those particular muscles. This level was reduced to 3%-9% of maximal voluntary contraction for the supported conditions. No effect on external oblique and rectus abdominis activity was observed. Moreover, no pain or discomfort was reported by any of the participants during the experiment. The results from the current experiment also suggests the necessity of lumber stabilizing systems while using trunk orthosis.The developed orthosis reduces trunk muscle activation level and provides a solid step for further development of support systems for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.The current study was approved by the medical ethics committee Arnhem-Nijmegen (study number: NL53143.091.15 ), The Netherlands.",

          "abstract": "Various stimuli such as the flexibility of lumbopelvic structures influence the neuromuscular responses of the trunk musculature, leading to different load sharing strategies and reflex muscle responses from the afferents of lumbopelvic mechanoreceptors. This link between flexibility and neuromuscular response has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lumbopelvic flexibility and neuromuscular responses of the erector spinae, hamstring and abdominal muscles during trunk flexion-extension. Lumbopelvic movement patterns were measured in 29 healthy women, who were separated into two groups according to their flexibility during trunk flexion-extension. The electromyographic responses of erector spinae, rectus abdominis and biceps femoris were also recorded. Subjects with greater lumbar flexibility had significantly less pelvic flexibility and vice versa. Subjects with greater pelvic flexibility had a higher rate of relaxation and lower levels of hamstring activation during maximal trunk flexion. The neuromuscular response patterns of the hamstrings seem partially modulated by pelvic flexibility. Not so with the lumbar erector spinae and lumbar flexibility, despite the assertions of some previous studies. The results of this study improve our knowledge of the relationships between trunk joint flexibility and neuromuscular responses, a relationship which may play a role in low back pain.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Both groups showed significant decreases in COGP distance and RA muscle activity compared with their respective baseline values (p < 0.05), however, no significant changes were observed in SEM muscle activity.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of adding elastic bands to free-weight squats on the neuromuscular activation of core muscles. Twenty-five resistance trained women with 4.6 ± 2.1 years of resistance training experience participated in the study. In randomized order, the participants performed 6 repetition maximum in free-weight squats, with and without elastic bands (i.e., matched relative intensity between exercises). During free-weight squats with elastic bands, some of the free weights were replaced with 2 elastic bands attached to the lowest part of the squat rack. Surface electromyography (EMG) activity was measured from the erector spinae, external oblique, and rectus abdominis, whereas a linear encoder measured the vertical displacement. The EMG activities were compared between the 2 lifting modalities for the whole repetition and separately for the eccentric, concentric, and upper and lower eccentric and concentric phases. In the upper (greatest stretch of the elastic band), middle, and lower positions in squats with elastic bands, the resistance values were approximately 117, 105, and 93% of the free weight-only trial. Similar EMG activities were observed for the 2 lifting modalities for the erector spinae (p = 0.112-0.782), external oblique (p = 0.225-0.977), and rectus abdominis (p = 0.315-0.729) in all analyzed phases.

          "abstract": "In this paper, the authors investigate the passive viscoelastic properties of rabbit abdominal wall. In vitro strain relaxation tests were performed in the oblique muscle (in two perpendicular directions), the rectus abdominis and the linea alba in the longitudinal direction. Based on experimental data, a model for the viscoelastic mechanical properties of this tissue is presented here. In particular, we used a 3D non-linear viscoelastic model to fit data sets obtained from tissue of the rabbit abdominal wall. Uniaxial relaxation tests were carried out for samples obtained from the abdominal wall. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the anisotropy and nonlinearity of the abdominal tissue. The stress relaxation was higher in the transverse direction (closer to muscle fibers) with an average value of the final stress ratio of 48%, than in the longitudinal direction with around 56% of this ratio for the oblique muscle. These tests, at several stretch levels, presented a different behavior depending on the region where the tissue sample was located. There was no dependence between the stress relaxation ratio and the stretch level for the oblique muscles in their longitudinal or transverse directions (p>0.01). In contrast, for rectus abdominis and linea alba a dependence between the stress relaxation ratio and stretch level was found. Our study revealed an increase in the stress relaxation ratio for the rectus abdominis (p<0.01) and a decrease for the linea alba with higher stretch levels (p<0.01).

The full dataset and subsamples (n = 10 (5 ♂, 5 ♀) to n = 120 (60 ♂, 60 ♀)) thereof were used to assess the effect of sample size on the differential expression of single genes, gene rank order and prediction accuracy. Using our full dataset (n = 134), we identified 717 differentially expressed transcripts (p<0.0001) and we were able predict sex with ~90% accuracy, both within our dataset and on external datasets. Both p-values and rank order of top differentially expressed genes became more variable using smaller subsamples. For example, at n = 10 (5 ♂, 5 ♀), no gene was considered differentially expressed at p<0.0001 and prediction accuracy was ~50% (no better than chance). We found that sample size clearly affects microarray analysis results; small sample sizes result in unstable gene lists and poor prediction accuracy.

Distribution of thickness according to manufacturer specifications in the dry state were as follows: 0.009 inches to 0.013 inches (1 [1.6%]); 0.79 mm to 1.78 mm (3 [4.8%]); 0.79 mm to 2.03 mm (5 [8%]); 0.8 mm to 3.3 mm (1 [1.6%]); 1.8 mm to 3.3 mm (10 [16.1%]) and 28 mm (6 [9.7%]).

Slack sarcomere lengths were measured and elastic moduli were calculated from stress-strain data. Titin molecular mass was also measured from single muscle fibers. No significant differences were found among the four abdominal wall muscles in terms of slack sarcomere length or elastic modulus. Interestingly, across all four muscles, slack sarcomere lengths were quite long in individual muscle fibers (>2.4 µm), and demonstrated a significantly longer slack length in comparison to fiber bundles (p < 0.0001). Also, the extracellular connective tissue matrix provided a stiffening effect and enhanced the resistance to lengthening at long muscle lengths.

          "abstract": "Rib stress fractures (RSFs) can have serious effects on rowing training and performance and accordingly represent an important topic for sports medicine practitioners. Therefore, the aim of this review is to outline the definition, epidemiology, mechanisms, intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, injury management and injury prevention strategies for RSF in rowers. To this end, nine relevant books, 140 journal articles, the proceedings of five conferences and two unpublished presentations were reviewed after searches of electronic databases using the keywords 'rowing', 'rib', 'stress fracture', 'injury', 'mechanics' and 'kinetics'. The review showed that RSF is an incomplete fracture occurring from an imbalance between the rate of bone resorption and the rate of bone formation. RSF occurs in 8.1-16.4% of elite rowers, 2% of university rowers and 1% of junior elite rowers. Approximately 86% of rowing RSF cases with known locations occur in ribs four to eight, mostly along the anterolateral/lateral rib cage. Elite rowers are more likely to experience RSF than nonelite rowers. Injury occurrence is equal among sweep rowers and scullers, but the regional location of the injury differs. The mechanism of injury is multifactorial with numerous intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors contributing. Posterior-directed resultant forces arising from the forward directed force vector through the arms to the oar handle in combination with the force vector induced by the scapula retractors during mid-drive, or repetitive stress from the external obliques and rectus abdominis in the 'finish' position, may be responsible for RSF. Joint hypomobility, vertebral malalignment or low bone mineral density may be associated with RSF. Case studies have shown increased risk associated with amenorrhoea, low bone density or poor technique, in combination with increases in training volume. Training volume alone may have less effect on injury than other factors. Large differences in seat and handle velocity, sequential movement patterns, higher elbow-flexion to knee-extension strength ratios, higher seat-to-handle velocity during the initial drive, or higher shoulder angle excursion may result in RSF. Gearing may indirectly affect rib loading. Increased risk may be due to low calcium, low vitamin D, eating disorders, low testosterone or use of depot medroxyprogesterone injections. Injury management involves 1-2 weeks cessation of rowing with analgesic modalities followed by a slow return to rowing with low-impact intensity and modified pain-free training. Some evidence shows injury prevention strategies should focus on strengthening the serratus anterior, strengthening leg extensors, stretching the lumbar spine, increasing hip joint flexibility, reducing excessive protraction, training with ergometers on slides or floating-head ergometers, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Future research should focus on the epidemiology of RSF over 4-year Olympic cycles in elite rowers, the aetiology of the condition, and the effectiveness of RSF prevention strategies for injury incidence and performance in rowing.",

Due to the lack of randomised control trials, meta-analysis was not possible.Seven studies report that patient satisfaction was high following surgery. The most common complication seen was the development of a seroma. Other common complications included haematomas, minor skin necrosis, wound infections, dehiscence, post-operative pain, nerve damage and recurrence, the rate of which may be as high as 40%.Further studies are required to compare laparoscopic and open abdominoplasty techniques. Patients and physicians should be advised that correction is largely cosmetic, and although divarications may be unsightly they do not carry the same risks of actual herniation. Progressive techniques have resulted in risk reduction with no associated surgical mortality. However, the outcomes may be imperfect, with unsightly scarring, local sepsis and the possibility of recurrence.",

When the inferior epigastric artery is torn, blood dissects along the rectus sheath leading to hematoma formation.

Functional results were evaluated at regular intervals by questionnaire, physical examination, and balloon manometry. Continence was graded according to Kirwan. Satisfaction with continence was assessed by questionnaire.A total of 14 patients (3 women) were included. Tumors were adenocarcinoma (n = 11), squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 2), and melanoma (n = 1). Complete (R0) resection was achieved in all patients without perioperative deaths, major postoperative morbidity, or conversion to permanent iliac colostomy. Early postoperative complications (perineal wound infection, flap dehiscence, and partial perineal stoma necrosis) occurred in the first 4 patients. Late complications occurred in 7 patients, with mucosal prolapse in 3, stomal stricture in 4, and tumor recurrence in 1. Fecal continence progressed consistently with time, and by the end of the first year 8 patients (57%) had complete continence (grade A), 5 (36%) were continent with minor soiling (grade C), and 1 (7%) still had major soiling (grade D). After 6 months, 9 patients (64%) were satisfied with continence; after 1 year, 13 patients (93%) were satisfied. Regular enemas were necessary during the first year to improve soiling, and 8 patients (57%) were not in need after that.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the reliability and advantages of the slit arteriotomy for end-to-side arterial anastomosis.Sixty free flaps for reconstruction of the upper and lower extremities were re-vascularised using this technique. Flaps used were: gracilis (20), latissimus dorsi (18), rectus abdominis (6), lateral arm (6), fibula (3), radial forearm (4), scapular (1) and anterolateral thigh (2).A double microclamp is applied. Using a 30 degrees microknife, a longitudinal slit is made on the recipient vessel. The clamps are then approximated slightly. This slackens the segment bearing the slit and opens up the slit to facilitate placement of sutures. Beginning at the heel, interrupted sutures are placed in such a way as to feed the redundancy of the donor artery wall towards the toe of the anastomosis. A slightly oversized slit is used to stretch the donor vessel, which due to its inherent elastic recoil keeps the anastomosis patent. Once the tourniquet is released, blood flow resumes and the slit forms an elliptical opening. A video is available for viewing at our website: www.microflap.com.The arterial patency rate was 98%. The mechanical advantage of the slit arteriotomy construct was demonstrated through computer simulation on a finite-element analysis model.The slit arteriotomy is simple, reliable, and can be consistently used in the transfer of free flaps to the extremities. As no portion of the recipient vessel wall is excised, the anastomotic diameter is increased. This promotes blood flow through the anastomosis.(c) 2008. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

A gentle pushing force by the dissector could stretch the SPF and extend the subfascial pocket further at the lateral border of pectoralis major muscle (PM). The dissector head stayed inside the pocket, not perforating through the fascia. Near the inferior border of PM at the level of the sixth intercostal space, the dissection was hard to advance down beyond rectus abdominis muscle (RA). Yet a continuous vigorous dissection led into the subcutaneous layer of the abdominal wall over RA. The SPF is thick and continues to superficial axillary fascia at the lateral end of the muscle. At the inferior border of the PM (sixth intercostal space), however, the pectoral fascia became thin and feeble.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of posture on the expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles. Fifteen young adult men participated in the study. Activities of the external oblique abdominis, internal oblique abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles were measured electromyographically in various postures. We used a pressure threshold in order to activate the abdominal muscles as these muscles are silent at rest. A spirometer was used to measure the lung volume in various postures. Subjects were placed in the supine, standing, sitting, and sitting-with-elbow-on-the-knee (SEK) positions. Electromyographic activity and mouth pressure were measured during spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary ventilation under the respiratory load. We observed that the lung volume changed with posture; however, the breathing pattern under respiratory load did not change. During maximal voluntary ventilation, internal oblique abdominis muscle expiratory activity was lower in the SEK position than in any other position, external oblique abdominis muscle inspiratory activity was lower in the supine position than in any other position, and internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher in the standing position than in any other position. During spontaneous breathing, external oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during expiration and inspiration in the SEK position than in any other position. The internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during both inspiration and expiration in the standing position than in any other position. The rectus abdominis muscle activity did not change with changes in posture during both inspiration and expiration. Increase in the external oblique abdominis activity in the SEK position was due to anatomical muscle arrangement that was consistent with the direction of lower rib movement. On the other hand, increase in the internal oblique abdominis activity in the standing position was due to stretching of the abdominal wall by the viscera. We concluded that differences in activity were due to differences in the anatomy of the abdominal muscles and the influence of gravity.",

          "abstract": "The muscle force-stiffness relationship has often been modeled as linear, while in situ muscle research has clearly demonstrated non-linearity. Estimation of rotational joint stability relies on both a muscle's instantaneous pre-perturbation force and stiffness. Under conditions of static equilibrium, a muscle's stiffness will function in a stabilizing manner, while its force can function in either a stabilizing or destabilizing manner depending on the muscle's orientation about the joint.A single muscle (rectus abdominis) was modeled and its individual direct stabilizing potential about the L4-L5 spine joint was analyzed. Three force-stiffness relationships were examined: (1) linear; (2) non-linear with moderate stiffness magnitudes; (3) non-linear with higher stiffness magnitudes.With a linear force-stiffness relationship, stability increased proportional to muscle force; with a non-linear relationship, stability peaked and subsequently decreased at submaximal muscle forces. When considering the lower, as opposed to the higher non-linear stiffness magnitudes, the stabilizing potential of the muscle peaked at a lower muscle force level and actually became negative (destabilizing) at a critical stiffness magnitude.It was concluded that a non-linear muscle force-stiffness relationship greatly alters the individual stabilizing potential of the muscle throughout its progression of force development. A muscle's stabilizing contribution may actually peak at and subsequently decrease above a critical submaximal force level. Incorporating this knowledge into stability models may assist in recognizing unstable events that lead to injury at higher levels of muscle activation.",

          "abstract": "The etiology of lower abdominal bulge following breast reconstruction with the DIEP flap is uncertain. Most studies report an incidence that ranges from 0.7% to 5%. The purpose of this study was to review a set of factors that may predispose to a lower abdominal bulge. This was a retrospective review of 123 women who had breast reconstruction with the DIEP flap over a 4-year period. The reconstruction was unilateral in 93 women and bilateral in 30 women, totaling 153 flaps. Etiologic factors that were evaluated included patient age, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, previous abdominal operations, unilateral or bilateral reconstruction, previous childbirth, aponeurotic plication to improve the natural abdominal contour, and use of Marlex mesh. A lower abdominal bulge occurred in 5 of the 123 women (4%), 2 following 30 bilateral reconstructions (6.6%) and 3 following 93 unilateral reconstructions (3.2%). Analysis of the factors for all women demonstrated diabetes mellitus in 1 (0.8%), tobacco use in 9 (7.3%), a prior abdominal operation in 55 (44.7%), previous childbirth in 95 (77%), aponeurotic plication in 49 (40%), and use of Marlex mesh in 4 (3.3%). Statistical analysis did not show any significant association between the explanatory factors and the occurrence of a lower abdominal bulge, except for a weak trend in women who had not been pregnant (P = 0.08). The results of this study demonstrate that the occurrence of a lower abdominal bulge following the DIEP flap is a random event that can occur in anyone. Pregnancy may confer a preventative effect as the collagen fibers strengthen to overcome the stretching forces. Techniques for prevention and treatment include intraoperative assessment of the anterior rectus sheath, use of an adjuvant material for reinforcement if unstable, and vertical plication for bulge repair.",

Reflex responses of the following abdominal muscles were investigated both ipsilateral and contralateral to the tap: rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO) and internal oblique (IO). Reflexes were evoked in each of the homonymous muscles with latencies and estimated conduction velocities compatible with being evoked by Ia muscle afferents and having a monosynaptic component. Short latency heteronymous excitatory reflex connections were also observed in muscles on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides in response to the same stimulus. The latencies of the crossed responses were only marginally longer than responses evoked in the respective ipsilateral muscle. Moreover, the reflexes evoked in the IO muscle from ipsilateral and contralateral IO muscle afferents were of comparable amplitude, as were those reflexes evoked in ipsilateral and contralateral EO and RA muscles when tapping IO. These similarities in the reflex characteristics on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides suggest that abdominal muscle afferents activate similar pathways to muscles on both sides of the body. It follows that if the homonymous stretch reflex of abdominal muscles have a monosynaptic component, then a similar monosynaptic pathway activates synergistic motoneurones, not only ipsilaterally but also contralaterally.",

The purpose of this study was to present a safe alternative to conventional abdominoplasty for appropriate patients, namely, those with minimal skin laxity, moderate fatty tissue distribution, musculofascial diastases, and no concern for abdominal stretch marks. The procedure consists of circumferential ultrasound-assisted liposuction and direct abdominal wall plication through a periumbilical incision. Thirty-two patients were evaluated on overall patient satisfaction and complication rates, including seroma (five, 15.6 percent), major sensory loss (none), skin slough (none), skin burns (none), end hits (i.e., a small, partial-thickness, subdermal burn; one, 3 percent), and limited results (two, 6 percent).

          "abstract": "The \"gold standard\" in surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is sling operation with polypropylene tape appliance under the mid urethra. There are two types of polypropylene tape which are the most popular nowadays. These two tapes are differently knitted so they have different biomechanical features. The TVT tape is monofilament, rarely knitted and highly elastic but the IVS mesh is multifilament, densly knitted and has only little possibility to stretch. The aim of our study was to assess the tissue reaction to the mono-(TVT) and multifilament (IVS) tapes.The 10 mm x 10 mm pieces of TVT and IVS tapes were implanted inlay the fascia of musculus abdominis rectus of 14 rat females (2 groups of 7 animals). The tapes with the margin of surrounding fascia were taken off after 6 weeks of healing. All samples were fixed in 10% Formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline and embedded in paraffin. Four micron tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the reticulin silver impregnation stain according to Gomori (for collagen type III) and periodic acid Schiff and alcian blue (for proteoglycan).In all sections filaments visible as elipsoids were surrounded by resorptive granulation with large multinucleated giant cells like around \"foreign body\". The diameter of monofilaments was about 150 microns. The connective tissue in the vicinity of mesh was rich of inflammatory cells like histiocytes, lymphocytes, a few polymorphonuclear leucocytes as well as adipocytes and fibroblasts. The large multinucleated giant cells adjacent to monofilaments were relatively bigger than these cells around multifilaments. Moreover, this granulation tissue has a lot of new blood vessels and collagenous fibrous tissue. The multifilaments were about 40 microns in diameter. The inflammatory granulation infiltrated aggregates of multifilaments. This tissue had only few inflammatory cells in comparison to tissue around monofilaments. The large multinucleated giant cells apposed to the mesh were small and collagen created thicker, more compacted bundles.The multifilament polypropylene tape induces weaker inflammatory tissue reaction than monofilament mesh. The thicker and more compacted collagen bundles are created around multifilaments so the natural tensile strength of the surrounding tissue is probably higher.",

          "abstract": "We studied the effects of four variables on the histological properties of three body wall muscles-rectus abdominis (RA), transversus abdominis (TA), and external oblique (EO)-from pregnant rats. The variables examined were (1) gestation period; (2) cage design; (3) the effect of a midline laparotomy, performed to determine fetus numbers; and (4) exposure to a nine-day spaceflight. We measured fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), metabolic enzyme levels (succinate dehydrogenase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase), and myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunoreactivity in samples from each muscle. A major effect of spaceflight was an increase of 42-171% in fibers double-labeled for MHC in all three muscles. Based on fiber CSA, the TA and RA muscles showed signs of stretching with increased gestation; i.e., the CSA decreased 11-12% over a nine-day period. The EO, a torso rotator, hypertrophied by 9% in rats group-housed in cages with a complex 3-D structure, compared to controls housed singly in standard flat-bottom cages. The TA and EO, whose contractions would pull on the suture line, showed signs of atrophy in laparotomized animals, exhibiting a 12% decrease in muscle fiber CSA. Exposure to weightlessness is known to induce atrophy in most skeletal muscles. Surprisingly, the EO actually hypertrophied 11% in our flight animals; however, this can be explained by the fact that those rats actively rotated their torsos seven times more often than ground controls. The flight rats also had twice as many contractions as controls. However, they were still able to give birth on time postflight.Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The patient was successfully resuscitated and her life was sustained by artificial ventilator for 100 days. All brainstem reflexes were absent, and flat electroencephalogram and no response of brainstem auditory evoked potentials were confirmed twice with an interval of over 6 hours. Flexion of the arm induced reflex rectus abdominis muscle contraction, resembling expiratory movement. Muscle stretch reflexes on rectus abdominis were hyperactive. The expiration-like movement appeared in an apnea test seven minutes after a cessation of artificial ventilation. Electrical stimuli on femoral nerve induced complex action potentials with a 70.2 +/- 6.9 msec latency and 300 msec duration in rectus abdominis muscle, which were similar to the spino-bulbo-spinal reflex. Single photon emission tomography showed only slight cerebral cortical blood flow.

          "abstract": "Diastasis rectus abdominis is a condition in which the rectus abdominis muscles separate and move laterally, causing stretching of the linea alba tissue with weakness of the abdominal wall. Although it can lead to hernia of the abdominal viscera, diastasis rectus abdominis is not a hernia in itself. This condition is common among women during pregnancy and the postpartum period and can significantly affect their quality of life and their return to sports activity. Unfortunately, information on the incidence, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of diastasis rectus abdominis are limited.We conducted a pilot prospective observational study on 37 patients who practiced sports at high levels (at least 3 times a week with amateur/competitive competitions) who underwent ultrasound measurements of the distance between the rectus abdominis muscles at the level of the xiphoid process, supraumbilical, umbilical, and subumbilical at time (T0), after 2 months from the rehabilitation protocol (T1), and then after 4 months of rehabilitation protocol (T2) from approximately 3 months after giving birth, and we saw an early return to sport.Our data analysis reveals that there is an initial decrease in diastasis during the first 2 months with 3 weekly physiotherapy activity sessions in all 4 measurements. One session takes place on site with physiotherapists, while the other 2 are carried out at home using the rehabilitation protocol provided by the medical staff. At the 4-month follow-up, the improvement was similar to the previous follow-up.Of the 37 women analyzed, 6 were referred to the surgeon; 2 for hernias and 4 for diastases greater than 4 cm.

The use of foam rollers (FR) have been purported to improve the recruitment of core muscles by creating an unstable surface, providing improvements to balance, posture and functional recovery in daily activities. However, there is a paucity of studies exploring the use of FR as an unstable surface. The aim of this study was to analyze the acute effects on the recruitment of core muscles during two Pilates exercises, a single leg stretch (SL) and single straight leg stretch (SS), on the ground and using a FR as an unstable surface. Thirty women aged between 25 and 35 years old who had not previously practiced Pilates participated in this study. Surface EMG signals were collected from rectus abdominis (RA) and external oblique (EO) muscles during an isometric contraction lasting 30 s during the exercises. Two-factor Repeated Measures ANOVA tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons were used to investigate the muscle activity between the two stretching exercises when performed on the ground and using the FR. No significant interaction effects were seen between the two exercises and positions, and no main effects were seen for either factor. These findings do not indicate the influence of the surface (ground versus FR) or exercise (SL versus SS) on the muscle activity of the rectus abdominis and external oblique muscles when considering the immediate effects.

This study aimed to compare the subjects with and without Pilates experience to find out the effect of the experience on the core muscle activity and muscle co-contraction, and to examine the relationship between the core muscle activation level and the kinematic data. This study involved 32 subjects, including 16 experienced Pilates practitioners and 16 non-experienced subjects. The knee stretch on the reformer was performed in three different positions: flat back with a neutral pelvis, round back with posteriorly tilted pelvis (RPP), and extended back anteriorly tilted pelvis (EAP). The electromyography of the internal oblique (IO), rectus abdominis (RA), multifidus (MU), and iliocostalis lumborum (IL) muscles were measured, as well as kinematic data from a 3D motion analysis system. Compared to the non-experienced subjects, the experienced subjects activated the IO muscles more than the RA muscles, and the most significant difference was seen in the RPP position (p < 0.05). The experienced patients activated the MU muscles more often than the IL muscles, with the most significant difference observed in the RPP position and the least significant in the EAP position (p < 0.05). All kinematic data and muscle activity (IO, IO/RA ratio, MU/IL ratio) showed significant differences between the experienced and non-experienced subjects (p < 0.05). The subjects presented a moderate correlation between muscle activation and core stability. It was confirmed that the experienced Pilates practitioners activated the abdominal and low back core muscles effectively, and the stability of the pelvis and trunk were better than that of the non-experienced participants.

          "abstract": "Core strengthening and postural stability are desired outcomes of certain therapeutic exercises performed in horses. This study aimed to quantify changes in muscle activation at a walk and trot in horses traveling over eight consecutive ground poles evenly spaced (at 30 inches for walk and 48 inches for trot) in parallel fashion in a straight line, and with hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands applied at 25% stretch. Surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected for the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles in six horses. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was performed for each muscle to test for significant differences in differences in normalized average rectified values and maximum low pass signals. Within subject effects were reported, followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons to evaluate differences between the conditions of with or without ground poles or elastic resistance bands. The use of ground poles at a walk resulted in a significant (p < .05) increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles, with an increase in the average rectified value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles and right longissimus dorsi muscle. The use of ground poles at a trot resulted in a significant increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles. The hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands resulted in a respective 27% and 27.2% increase in the mean average rectified value of the left and right RA muscles; however this only reached statistical significance in the left RA (p < .05). These findings provide support regarding changes in muscle activation when using ground poles to increase core and epaxial muscle engagement. While a significant effect on core muscle activation was identified with the elastic resistance bands at a trot, further research is needed in this area to further characterize their effects on muscle activation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The primary objective of this study is a palpation assessment of RAD in postpartum women before and after the application of KT tapes and a subsequent comparison of the results with those from a sham intervention group.A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Physical Therapy Department at Wroclaw Medical University. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the KT group (intervention), in which KT tapes were applied (48 h intervention) and the sham KT group (control, sham intervention), in which non-stretch tapes were used (cloth surgical tape, 48 h intervention). In all participants, a palpation assessment of RAD was conducted and the inter-recti distance was measured using a digital caliper at three sites: at the umbilicus and 4.5 cm above and below it. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention.The gathered results show a statistically significant reduction in rectus abdominis diastasis at each of the observed sites after the application of KT tapes in the intervention group (p < 0.05). In the intergroup comparison, a statistically significantly lower RAD (at umbilicus) was found after the intervention (p = 0.005) in KT group.the application of KT tapes using the corrective technique can contribute to reducing RAD in women up to 12 months after delivery.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the anatomical relation of the rectus abdominis muscles with the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths. The elastic behavior of these fascial sheets is also assessed. Both of these analyses form an anatomic-biomechanical basis for diagnosis and treatment, especially in relation to diastasis recti abdominis (DRA).Fundamental observational, biomechanical study. Seven post-mortem, embalmed human specimens were dissected. The abdominal muscles and the fascial sheets of the abdominal wall were dissected. 4 × 4 cm samples of the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths were loaded in longitudinal and transverse direction, while recording elongation by means of a displacement sensor. The main outcome measures were anatomical descriptions and elongation of fascia samples in mm (mean and standard ± deviation).In longitudinal direction the posterior rectus sheath samples stretched over 1.67 ± 0.48 mm, while in transverse direction the mean stretch was 0.29 ± 0.18 mm (p = 0.001). In contrast, no significant difference between longitudinal (0.78 ± 0.43 mm) and transversal displacement (0.50 ± 0.23 mm) was observed in the anterior rectus sheath (p = 0.56).The posterior rectus sheath is functionally more related to the transverse abdominis muscle than to the rectus abdominis muscle. From this connection, in combination with the specific stiffness of the posterior fascia in the lateral direction, it is assumed that the transverse abdominis muscles play an important role in the etiology but also in reduction of DRA.

          "abstract": "Researchers increasingly use intraoperative muscle biopsy to investigate mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy in patients with cancer. Muscles have been assessed for morphological, cellular, and biochemical features. The aim of this study was to conduct a state-of-the-science review of this literature and, secondly, to evaluate clinical and biological variation in biopsies of rectus abdominis (RA) muscle from a cohort of patients with malignancies.Literature was searched for reports on muscle biopsies from patients with a cancer diagnosis. Quality of reports and risk of bias were assessed. Data abstracted included patient characteristics and diagnoses, sample size, tissue collection and biobanking procedures, and results. A cohort of cancer patients (n = 190, 88% gastrointestinal malignancies), who underwent open abdominal surgery as part of their clinical care, consented to RA biopsy from the site of incision. Computed tomography (CT) scans were used to quantify total abdominal muscle and RA cross-sectional areas and radiodensity. Biopsies were assessed for muscle fibre area (μm2 ), fibre types, myosin heavy chain isoforms, and expression of genes selected for their involvement in catabolic pathways of muscle.Muscle biopsy occurred in 59 studies (total N = 1585 participants). RA was biopsied intraoperatively in 40 studies (67%), followed by quadriceps (26%; percutaneous biopsy) and other muscles (7%). Cancer site and stage, % of male participants, and age were highly variable between studies. Details regarding patient medical history and biopsy procedures were frequently absent. Lack of description of the population(s) sampled and low sample size contributed to low quality and risk of bias. Weight-losing cases were compared with weight stable cancer or healthy controls without considering a measure of muscle mass in 21 out of 44 studies. In the cohort of patients providing biopsy for this study, 78% of patients had preoperative CT scans and a high proportion (64%) met published criteria for sarcopenia. Fibre type distribution in RA was type I (46% ± 13), hybrid type I/IIA (1% ± 1), type IIA (36% ± 10), hybrid type IIA/D (15% ± 14), and type IID (2% ± 5). Sexual dimorphism was prominent in RA CT cross-sectional area, mean fibre cross-sectional area, and in expression of genes associated with muscle growth, apoptosis, and inflammation (P < 0.05). Medical history revealed multiple co-morbid conditions and medications.Continued collaboration between researchers and cancer surgeons enables a more complete understanding of mechanisms of cancer-associated muscle atrophy. Standardization of biobanking practices, tissue manipulation, patient characterization, and classification will enhance the consistency, reliability, and comparability of future studies.© 2019 The Authors Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders.",

          "abstract": "Various stimuli such as the flexibility of lumbopelvic structures influence the neuromuscular responses of the trunk musculature, leading to different load sharing strategies and reflex muscle responses from the afferents of lumbopelvic mechanoreceptors. This link between flexibility and neuromuscular response has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lumbopelvic flexibility and neuromuscular responses of the erector spinae, hamstring and abdominal muscles during trunk flexion-extension. Lumbopelvic movement patterns were measured in 29 healthy women, who were separated into two groups according to their flexibility during trunk flexion-extension. The electromyographic responses of erector spinae, rectus abdominis and biceps femoris were also recorded. Subjects with greater lumbar flexibility had significantly less pelvic flexibility and vice versa. Subjects with greater pelvic flexibility had a higher rate of relaxation and lower levels of hamstring activation during maximal trunk flexion. The neuromuscular response patterns of the hamstrings seem partially modulated by pelvic flexibility. Not so with the lumbar erector spinae and lumbar flexibility, despite the assertions of some previous studies. The results of this study improve our knowledge of the relationships between trunk joint flexibility and neuromuscular responses, a relationship which may play a role in low back pain.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of adding elastic bands to free-weight squats on the neuromuscular activation of core muscles. Twenty-five resistance trained women with 4.6 ± 2.1 years of resistance training experience participated in the study. In randomized order, the participants performed 6 repetition maximum in free-weight squats, with and without elastic bands (i.e., matched relative intensity between exercises). During free-weight squats with elastic bands, some of the free weights were replaced with 2 elastic bands attached to the lowest part of the squat rack. Surface electromyography (EMG) activity was measured from the erector spinae, external oblique, and rectus abdominis, whereas a linear encoder measured the vertical displacement. The EMG activities were compared between the 2 lifting modalities for the whole repetition and separately for the eccentric, concentric, and upper and lower eccentric and concentric phases. In the upper (greatest stretch of the elastic band), middle, and lower positions in squats with elastic bands, the resistance values were approximately 117, 105, and 93% of the free weight-only trial. Similar EMG activities were observed for the 2 lifting modalities for the erector spinae (p = 0.112-0.782), external oblique (p = 0.225-0.977), and rectus abdominis (p = 0.315-0.729) in all analyzed phases. In conclusion, there were no effects on the muscle activity of trunk muscles of substituting some resistance from free weights with elastic bands in the free-weight squat.",

While many studies have described the safety and morbidity profiles of these materials, little is known about the relative mechanical properties of individual sheets of allograft harvested from distinct donors.Sixty-two individual sheets of an acellular dermal matrix from distinct lot numbers (signifying different donors of the dermis) were prospectively analyzed before use. Distribution of thickness according to manufacturer specifications in the dry state were as follows: 0.009 inches to 0.013 inches (1 [1.6%]); 0.79 mm to 1.78 mm (3 [4.8%]); 0.79 mm to 2.03 mm (5 [8%]); 0.8 mm to 3.3 mm (1 [1.6%]); 1.8 mm to 3.3 mm (10 [16.1%]) and 28 mm (6 [9.7%]). The size of the matrix was recorded while dry, after hydration and following stretch. The percentage change in surface area was recorded for each lot.The 62 reconstructive cases included breast implant reconstruction (2 [3.2%]); ventral hernia repair (11 [17.7%]); abdominal closure following autologous tissue harvest (6 [9.6%]); autologous breast reconstruction (37 [59.6%]); extremity wound closures (3 [4.8%]) and reinforcement of vertical rectus abdominis muscle closure (3 [4.8%]). The mean percentage change in the size of the acellular dermal matrix to the hydrated state was 58% (36 of 62; thickness 0.06 mm to 3.30 mm); the mean percentage change in size from dry state was 7.14% (range 0% to 18.7%). The mean percentage change in the size of the hydrated matrix to the stretched state was 25.7% (range 0.25% to 70.6%).

Studying passive mechanical properties of these muscles may provide insights into their ability to transfer force among structures. Biopsies from rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and transverse abdominis (TrA) were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats, and single muscle fibers and fiber bundles (4-8 fibers ensheathed in their connective tissue matrix) were isolated and mechanically stretched in a passive state. Slack sarcomere lengths were measured and elastic moduli were calculated from stress-strain data. Titin molecular mass was also measured from single muscle fibers. No significant differences were found among the four abdominal wall muscles in terms of slack sarcomere length or elastic modulus. Interestingly, across all four muscles, slack sarcomere lengths were quite long in individual muscle fibers (>2.4 µm), and demonstrated a significantly longer slack length in comparison to fiber bundles (p < 0.0001). Also, the extracellular connective tissue matrix provided a stiffening effect and enhanced the resistance to lengthening at long muscle lengths. Titin molecular mass was significantly less in TrA compared to each of the other three muscles (p < 0.0009), but this difference did not correspond to hypothesized differences in stiffness.Copyright © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.",

A gentle pushing force by the dissector could stretch the SPF and extend the subfascial pocket further at the lateral border of pectoralis major muscle (PM).

Near the inferior border of PM at the level of the sixth intercostal space, the dissection was hard to advance down beyond rectus abdominis muscle (RA). Yet a continuous vigorous dissection led into the subcutaneous layer of the abdominal wall over RA. The SPF is thick and continues to superficial axillary fascia at the lateral end of the muscle. At the inferior border of the PM (sixth intercostal space), however, the pectoral fascia became thin and feeble.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of posture on the expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles. Fifteen young adult men participated in the study. Activities of the external oblique abdominis, internal oblique abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles were measured electromyographically in various postures. We used a pressure threshold in order to activate the abdominal muscles as these muscles are silent at rest. A spirometer was used to measure the lung volume in various postures. Subjects were placed in the supine, standing, sitting, and sitting-with-elbow-on-the-knee (SEK) positions. Electromyographic activity and mouth pressure were measured during spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary ventilation under the respiratory load. We observed that the lung volume changed with posture; however, the breathing pattern under respiratory load did not change. During maximal voluntary ventilation, internal oblique abdominis muscle expiratory activity was lower in the SEK position than in any other position, external oblique abdominis muscle inspiratory activity was lower in the supine position than in any other position, and internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher in the standing position than in any other position. During spontaneous breathing, external oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during expiration and inspiration in the SEK position than in any other position. The internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during both inspiration and expiration in the standing position than in any other position. The rectus abdominis muscle activity did not change with changes in posture during both inspiration and expiration. Increase in the external oblique abdominis activity in the SEK position was due to anatomical muscle arrangement that was consistent with the direction of lower rib movement. On the other hand, increase in the internal oblique abdominis activity in the standing position was due to stretching of the abdominal wall by the viscera. We concluded that differences in activity were due to differences in the anatomy of the abdominal muscles and the influence of gravity.",

          "abstract": "The etiology of lower abdominal bulge following breast reconstruction with the DIEP flap is uncertain. Most studies report an incidence that ranges from 0.7% to 5%. The purpose of this study was to review a set of factors that may predispose to a lower abdominal bulge. This was a retrospective review of 123 women who had breast reconstruction with the DIEP flap over a 4-year period. The reconstruction was unilateral in 93 women and bilateral in 30 women, totaling 153 flaps. Etiologic factors that were evaluated included patient age, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, previous abdominal operations, unilateral or bilateral reconstruction, previous childbirth, aponeurotic plication to improve the natural abdominal contour, and use of Marlex mesh. A lower abdominal bulge occurred in 5 of the 123 women (4%), 2 following 30 bilateral reconstructions (6.6%) and 3 following 93 unilateral reconstructions (3.2%). Analysis of the factors for all women demonstrated diabetes mellitus in 1 (0.8%), tobacco use in 9 (7.3%), a prior abdominal operation in 55 (44.7%), previous childbirth in 95 (77%), aponeurotic plication in 49 (40%), and use of Marlex mesh in 4 (3.3%). Statistical analysis did not show any significant association between the explanatory factors and the occurrence of a lower abdominal bulge, except for a weak trend in women who had not been pregnant (P = 0.08). The results of this study demonstrate that the occurrence of a lower abdominal bulge following the DIEP flap is a random event that can occur in anyone. Pregnancy may confer a preventative effect as the collagen fibers strengthen to overcome the stretching forces. Techniques for prevention and treatment include intraoperative assessment of the anterior rectus sheath, use of an adjuvant material for reinforcement if unstable, and vertical plication for bulge repair.",

          "abstract": "We studied the effects of four variables on the histological properties of three body wall muscles-rectus abdominis (RA), transversus abdominis (TA), and external oblique (EO)-from pregnant rats. The variables examined were (1) gestation period; (2) cage design; (3) the effect of a midline laparotomy, performed to determine fetus numbers; and (4) exposure to a nine-day spaceflight. We measured fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), metabolic enzyme levels (succinate dehydrogenase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase), and myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunoreactivity in samples from each muscle. A major effect of spaceflight was an increase of 42-171% in fibers double-labeled for MHC in all three muscles. Based on fiber CSA, the TA and RA muscles showed signs of stretching with increased gestation; i.e., the CSA decreased 11-12% over a nine-day period. The EO, a torso rotator, hypertrophied by 9% in rats group-housed in cages with a complex 3-D structure, compared to controls housed singly in standard flat-bottom cages. The TA and EO, whose contractions would pull on the suture line, showed signs of atrophy in laparotomized animals, exhibiting a 12% decrease in muscle fiber CSA. Exposure to weightlessness is known to induce atrophy in most skeletal muscles. Surprisingly, the EO actually hypertrophied 11% in our flight animals; however, this can be explained by the fact that those rats actively rotated their torsos seven times more often than ground controls. The flight rats also had twice as many contractions as controls. However, they were still able to give birth on time postflight.Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

          "abstract": "A 72-year-old female patient, hospitalized for parkinsonism, suffered cardiopulmonary arrest without any certain causes. The patient was successfully resuscitated and her life was sustained by artificial ventilator for 100 days. All brainstem reflexes were absent, and flat electroencephalogram and no response of brainstem auditory evoked potentials were confirmed twice with an interval of over 6 hours. Flexion of the arm induced reflex rectus abdominis muscle contraction, resembling expiratory movement. Muscle stretch reflexes on rectus abdominis were hyperactive. The expiration-like movement appeared in an apnea test seven minutes after a cessation of artificial ventilation. Electrical stimuli on femoral nerve induced complex action potentials with a 70.2 +/- 6.9 msec latency and 300 msec duration in rectus abdominis muscle, which were similar to the spino-bulbo-spinal reflex. Single photon emission tomography showed only slight cerebral cortical blood flow. The expiration-like movements observed in this case suggest a relationship not only with the spinal cord reflex but also with polysynaptic reflexes to reticular formation in the medulla oblongata.",

          "abstract": "The usual dissection by medical students of the anterior abdominal wall and the inguinal region proceeds from superficial to deep; special emphasis is placed on the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle and lateral muscular layers. We suggest an alternate approach to dissection of this region that has the following advantages: (1) sparing of delicate deep structures not often fully appreciated by students; (2) provision of an opportunity to visualize the region from a laparoscopic surgeon's vantage point; (3) considerably reduced time spent dissecting and identifying structures and relationships, especially peritoneal reflections important in laparoscopic procedures. Our dissection begins with bilateral subcostal incisions through the entire thickness of the anterior abdominal wall and peritoneum, which extend laterally and inferiorly to the level of the anterior superior iliac spines, thereby forming a large, inverted, U-shaped flap. This flap is reflected inferiorly, allowing abdominal viscera to be dissected, and ultimately removed en bloc. The flap is then drawn cranially and stretched somewhat to approximate its position when the abdomen is inflated with CO2 during laparoscopic procedures. Major landmarks, including the deep inguinal ring, are noted and the flap is again reflected inferiorly for dissection beginning with the peritoneum and transversalis fascia. This method of dissecting the anterior abdominal wall and inguinal region results in more facile and timely identification of both superficial and deep structures of the anterior abdominal wall and inguinal region, and provides a clinically relevant demonstration of anatomy from a laparoscopic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Using digital image analysis and several anatomical methods, morphometric analysis of nonspanning fibers which had tapering profiles at their intrafascicular termination sites and represented overlapping arrangements within the fiber fascicles was performed in the rat rectus abdominis. Special emphasis was focused on dimensional relationships occurring between overlapping portions and tapering segments and sarcomere lengths in non- and overlapping portions. Nonspanning fibers were found to overlap each other for more than 40% of their length. In length, their overlapping portions generally corresponded to their tapering segments, which were also greater than 40% of the fiber length. In addition, despite the presence of overlapping linkages, nonspanning fibers maintained a fairly uniform length irrespective of their overlapping and nonoverlapping portions. Overlapping linkages in fibers without tapering profiles have a larger cross-sectional area in the overlapping portion than in the non-overlapping one, resulting in a phenomenon which will cause different sarcomere lengths between the two portions during fiber stretching. The present results suggest that tapering profiles in the overlapping portion ensure uniform sarcomere lengths within nonspanning fibers, thereby providing mechanical stability in each fiber.",

A defect measuring 6-10 cm was formed in the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall (an approximate model of a hiatal opening). Several rows of crimping sutures were then applied to the aponeurosis of the rectus abdominis muscle above and below the defect. The force of stretching of the edges of the defect was studied by an elaborated tensiometric device after application of each row of crimping sutures.

The optimal zones in the operative field for applying the crimping sutures were also determined. On the basis of experimental study the authors developed and used in the clinic a method for autoplasty of ventral hernias based principally on placing sutures through the edges of the ventral defect only after their approximation, after preliminary removal of the stretching load experienced by the laparotomic wound.

We also investigated the action of the abdominal muscles on the displacement of costal and crural diaphragm. We found that 1) contraction time of RA was longer and that the RA developed greater force than the EO at submaximal stimulation frequencies; 2) maximal tetanic force and the active length-tension curves were similar in both abdominal muscles; 3) on passive stretch, the compliance of the RA was one-third that of the EO; 4) at supine FRC, the EO is operating at 83% of Lo, whereas the RA is operating at 105% of Lo; 5) stimulation of either RA or EO (abdominal pressure of 15 cmH2O) lengthened the costal and crural diaphragm toward their Lo values, with greater crural excursion occurring than costal.

No responses were obtained if subjects were instructed not to respond to the loads. When instructed and trained to maintain their pre-load position in spite of the load, a two-phase compensatory response was found. The initial response (phase I) was 100-300 msec in duration; it was followed by a continuous e.m.g. discharge (phase II) which continued to the offset of the pressure load. Subjects were also trained to make a single respiratory effort as quickly as possible after the load onset or after just an auditory stimulus. These were simple reaction time tasks of a traditional kind and the e.m.g. responses elicited were single, brief bursts.4. For all subjects and experimental conditions the e.m.g. response of the internal oblique occurred first, followed by the external oblique and then the rectus abdominis. For the ;maintain position' task, phase I latencies (internal oblique) averaged 66-90 msec for individual subjects, but for single trials with optimal conditions of practice and preparatory intervals these ranged from 42 to 110 msec with a third of the reactions occurring within 50-60 msec.5. The latencies for reaction time responses to loading were about 6 msec shorter than the phase I latencies. The latency distributions for the two types of responses were similar, and both were affected to the same degree by practice, and changing the length and variability of the preparatory interval. Because of these similarities we suggest that the phase I reaction was a learned response of a ;simple reaction time' type, and not comparable to late stretch reflexes such as the M2 of limb muscles.6. Arm muscle responses to respiratory pressure changes were measured in three subjects under identical conditions used to obtain load reaction times of abdominal muscles. These simple reaction times averaged 61-71 msec, and ranged from 42 to 97 msec. Therefore very short proprioceptive reaction times are not peculiar to the respiratory system, or to load perturbations of the responding muscle.7. Mechanical adjustments of airway pressure and lung volume in response to loading are first expressed at the mouth about 90 msec after abdominal muscle activity begins. In the ;maintain position' task, the accuracy with which pressure and volume adjustments were made during the last 1.5 sec of the loading period approximated that reported in the literature for trained singers holding a tone using constant expiratory pressure.",

Differential changes in muscle fiber diameters were noted in each of the three muscle fiber types. Slow oxidative fibers underwent an increase in diameter through the last half of pregnancy. The diameter was further increased as stretch of the muscle was released after birth, and did not decrease in the postpartum period. Fast glycolytic fibers decreased in diameter during the last half of pregnancy, but returned to the prepregnancy diameter in the first postpartum day.

The Reformer is one of the most popular and primary pieces used in Pilates core exercises, requiring effective control of core muscles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Reformer spring resistance on core muscle activity.18 healthy adult females (age: 29.83 ± 4.22 years, body height: 164.98 ± 4.14 cm, body mass: 53.67 ± 5.32 kg) participated in this study. Surface electromyography was recorded from six muscles: rectus abdominis, internal oblique, erector spinae, multifidus, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris during core exercises. Participants performed three core exercises (hip roll, knee-off, and elephant) under three different Reformer spring conditions (fixed platform, platform connected to springs with moderate resistance, platform connected to springs with low resistance).During the hip roll exercise, mean muscle activity of the rectus abdominis, erector spinae, multifidus, and biceps femoris was significantly increased on the low-resistance spring platform compared to the moderate-resistance platform and fixed platform conditions (p < 0.001). During the knee-off exercise, mean muscle activity of the rectus abdominis, internal oblique, erector spinae, and multifidus significantly increased on the low-resistance platform compared to the fixed platform (p < 0.001). Furthermore, during the elephant exercise, mean muscle activity of the rectus abdominis, internal oblique, and rectus femoris significantly increased on the low-resistance spring platform compared to the fixed platform (p < 0.001).These findings suggest the unstable platform caused by the Reformer spring modification impacts core muscle activity during basic core exercises.

Participants performed functional movement screening (FMS) tests and six Pilates exercises at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Surface electromyography (EMG) was utilized to measure muscle activity at four sites: right rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), multifidus (MU), and longissimus (LO). Mean EMG activity, co-contraction indices, and duration of core muscle activation were analyzed using independent t-tests to examine the differences between groups. Cohen's d was used to calculate effect sizes based on the standard deviations of the groups. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The experienced practitioners scored significantly higher in total FMS scores and in four sub-units of the FMS scores compared to the novice group (p ≤ 0.01). Mean EO EMG activity was also significantly greater in experienced practitioners during all Pilates exercises (p < 0.05). Additionally, the RA/EO co-contraction index was higher in experienced practitioners during the 'double leg stretch' exercise (p = 0.02).The results suggest that experienced Pilates practitioners have superior functional movement abilities and greater core muscle activation, particularly in the EO muscle group, compared to novice practitioners.

Before and after intervention, rectus abdominis muscle distance, waist circumference and abdominal circumference were evaluated in the two groups, and rectus abdominis muscle separation, waist circumference and abdominal circumference improvement were analyzed in the two groups.There was no significant difference between the two groups before treatment (P > 0.05), and there was significant difference between the two groups after treatment and before treatment. After treatment, the experimental group was further improved compared with the control group. After treatment, the distance between rectus muscles, abdominal circumference and waist circumference in both groups were decreased compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05). The distance between rectus muscles, abdominal circumference and waist circumference of the experimental group were smaller than those of the control group (P < 0.05).Core stabilization training based on biofeedback can effectively improve the symptoms of patients with postpartum rectus diastasis, help to reduce waist circumference and abdominal circumference, and accelerate the recovery of postpartum body shape.AJCEI Copyright © 2024.",

          "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of high-intensity deep squat training integrated with various blood flow restriction (BFR) modalities on the activation of lower limb and core muscles.A randomized, self-controlled crossover experimental design was employed with 12 participants. The exercise protocol consisted of squat training at 75% of one-repetition maximum (1RM), performed in 3 sets of 8 repetitions with a 2-min inter-set rest period. This was conducted under four distinct BFR conditions: continuous low BFR (T1), intermittent medium BFR (T2), intermittent high BFR (T3), and a non-restricted control (C). Surface electromyography (EMG) was utilized to collect EMG signals from the target muscles during the BFR and squat training sessions. The root mean square (RMS) amplitude standard values were calculated for each squat set to quantify muscle activation levels, with these values expressed as a percentage of the maximum voluntary contraction (%MVC). Rating of Perceived Exertion was evaluated after each squat set, and leg circumference measurements were taken.1) During the first two sets of deep squats, the %MVC of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis in all compression groups was significantly higher than that in the control group (p 0.05). In the first set, Group T3's erector spinae %MVC was significantly higher than the control group's; in the second set, it was significantly higher than both Group T2 and the control group's (p < 0.05). 4) After training, a significant increase in thigh circumference was observed in all groups compared to before training (p < 0.05). 5) For RPE values, Group T2's post-squat values were significantly higher than the control group's after all three sets (p < 0.05). Group T1's RPE values were also significantly higher than the control group's after the third set (p < 0.05). Groups T1, T2, and C all had significantly higher RPE values in the second and third sets compared to the first set (p < 0.05).All BFR modalities significantly enhanced the activation level of the anterior thigh muscles, with the continuous low BFR mode demonstrating a more stable effect. No significant differences were found in the activation level of the rectus abdominis among the groups. However, the intermittent high BFR mode was the most effective in increasing the activation level of the erector spinae muscles. While BFR did not further augment leg circumference changes, it did elevate subjective fatigue levels. The RPE was lowest during squatting under the intermittent high BFR condition.Copyright © 2024 Zhuan, Zhu, Zhou, Lei, Wang and Li.",

We aimed to compare the effects of conventional isolated shoulder exercise (ISE) and core-shoulder chain exercises (CCE) during isokinetic shoulder rotation in baseball pitchers with SIS. Forty male college baseball pitchers with SIS were randomly allocated to ISE and CCE groups and they performed the exercises 3 times a week for 6 weeks. The standardised numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), electromyography (EMG) amplitude, and concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) torques were measured. Substantial improvements in NPRS and SPADI scores were observed after CCE compared to ISE (p ≤ 0.046). Internal oblique/transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis, external oblique, serratus anterior, and infraspinatus muscle activation were significantly higher after CCE than ISE (p ≤ 0.033). CON and ECC torques were higher after CCE than ISE (p ≤ 0.002). The present findings demonstrated superior therapeutic effects of CCE in improving pain, disability level, shoulder muscle activation, and torque (muscle strength) in baseball pitchers with SIS compared to the conventional ISE, highlighting the importance of the chain exercise concept.",

          "abstract": "The importance of incorporating lumbo-pelvic stability core and controlling motor exercises in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) reinforces the use of strategies to improve biopsychosocial beliefs by reducing biomedical postulations. However, clinical practice guidelines recommend multimodal approaches incorporating exercise and manual therapy (MT), and instead reject the application of kinesiotape (KT) in isolation. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to analyze the effects of 12 weeks of exercises combined with MT or KT on perceived low back pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) and muscle electric activity measured with electromyography (EMG) of the rectus abdominis and multifidus in CLBP (mild disability) and to explore the relationship between the rectus abdominis and multifidus ratios and pain perception after intervention. A blinded, 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out, involving three parallel groups of patients with CLBP. The study was registered at Clinicaltrial.gov and assigned the identification number NCT05544890 (19/09/22). The trial underwent an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome revealed a multimodal treatment program supplemented by additional therapies such as MT and KT, resulting in significant reductions in perceived low back pain. The subjective assessment of individuals with CLBP indicated no discernible distinction between exclusive core stability exercises and control-motor training when combined with MT or KT. Notably, our findings demonstrated positive alterations in both the mean and peak EMG values of the right rectus abdominis in the exercise group, suggesting a beneficial impact on muscle activation. This study focused on assessing the activation levels of the trunk musculature, specifically the rectus abdominis (RA) and multifidus (MF), in individuals with CLBP exhibiting mild disability according to the Oswestry Disability Index. Importantly, improvements in the VAS values were observed independently of changes in muscle electrical activity.© 2024. The Author(s).",

Twenty healthy subjects performed a 5 s isometric hold during five two- and one-leg bridge exercises: (1) on right leg with left knee to chest (1LB-LFlex); (2) on right leg with left knee extended (1LB-LExt); (3) standard two-leg bridge (2LB); (4) two-leg bridge with resistance band around knees (2LB-ABD); and (5) two-leg bridge with ball between knees (2LB-ADD). Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected using a Noraxon Telemyo Direct Transmission System from fourteen muscles: (1) three superficial quadriceps (VM, VL, and RF); (2) three hip abductors (TFL, GMED, and GMAX); (3) medial hamstrings (ST) and lateral hamstrings (BF); (4) hip adductors (ADD); (5) erector spinae (ES); (6) latissimus dorsi (LATS); (7) upper rectus abdominis (RA); and (8) external oblique (EO) and internal oblique (IO). EMG data were normalized by maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs). A paired t-test (p < 0.01) was used to assess differences in normalized mean EMG activities between DF and PF for each exercise. EMG activities were significantly greater in DF than PF for the (a) VM, VL, and RF during 1LB-LFlex; (b) ADD during 1LB-LFlex, 1LB-LExt; (c) EO during 1LB-LFlex; and (d) IO during 1LB-LFex. In contrast, EMG activities were significantly greater in PF than DF for ST and BF during all five bridge exercises.

Twenty-two healthy participants (12 females, 23.5 ± 3.1 years) were recruited. LPHC stability was measured by number of errors committed during a seated trunk control test (STCT). Surface electromyography recorded muscle activity of rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique, internal oblique (IO), erector spinae, and gluteus medius during the STCT and single-leg squat, and was normalized to peak activity during the task. Two-dimensional motion analysis quantified frontal and sagittal plane kinematics of the trunk, hip, and knee. Following exhaustive exercise, STCT performance worsened (number of errors: pre: 5.5 (interquartile range (IQR) = 1.4-9.0), post: 8.0 (IQR = 3.6-11.3), p = 0.026.), RA activity increased during the single-leg squat (pre: 42.1 (IQR = 33.6-48.5)%, post: 61.1 (IQR = 39.4-156.7 %, p =.004), and participants displayed less hip and knee flexion (hip: pre: 72.4 ± 22.1°; post: 66.2 ± 22.5°, p =.049; knee: pre: 72.4 ± 15.4°; post: 67.4 ± 18.2°, p =.005). Full-body exhaustive exercise negatively affected isolated LPHC stability and resulted in greater RA activity during the single-leg squat. Hip and knee flexion decreased during a single-leg squat after exhaustive exercise which could indicate decreased athletic performance, but changes in the quality of movement during other tasks should be further investigated.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Group A included 20 athletes (18 males and 2 females) without LBP, and Group B included 20 athletes (12 males and 8 females) with LBP. Athletes with LBP were assessed using the Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MODQ) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to determine their level of disability and pain severity, respectively. EMG activity of the rectus abdominis, external oblique, longissimus, and multifidus was recorded in both groups as they performed bilateral isometric shoulder and trunk contractions.In the LBP group, EMG activity of the rectus abdominis and external oblique muscles was significantly lower (P < 0.05). The LBP group had significantly more multifidus activity (P = 0.03) than the NLBP group. Among all the exercises, bilateral isometric shoulder extension contraction activated the rectus abdominis, right external oblique, and longissimus group of muscles significantly more (P < 0.05) in both groups. In both groups, bilateral isometric shoulder flexion contraction resulted in significantly higher multifidus muscle activation (P = 0.002).The activation of core stabilizing muscles was altered in athletes with LBP.

          "abstract": "This study assessed the impact of different types of medial foot arch on postural stability and core center of gravity muscle activity among collegiate athletes.The study sample included 103 university-level athletes across various sports (soccer, rugby, basketball, volleyball, field tennis, table tennis, karate, and cheerleading) from the College of Magdalena (Colombia) who exhibited distinct types of medial foot arch: 32 high, 35 low, and 36 neutral arches. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was employed to assess conduction velocity, magnitude values, latency, and fatigue in focal muscles including the spinal erector (SE), internal oblique (IO), external oblique (EO), and rectus abdominis (AR), while measurements of static and dynamic postural control were also considered. Post hoc analysis was performed with Bonferroni correction for all electromyographically measured muscle groups, as well as for measurements of static and dynamic postural stability. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation tests were used to compare the different types of feet.There were no substantial differences observed between the distinct types of feet in terms of focal muscle activity, static stability, or dynamics. Even though the mean values indicated higher muscle activity and stability among those with high foot arches and lower values among those with low arches compared to the neutral foot type, this observed difference was deemed statistically insignificant. We also observed a positive correlation between internal oblique muscle activity and the average power of dynamic postural stability, which remained consistent across all foot types. Our findings indicate that static instability is directly correlated with dynamic instability in the anteroposterior direction, while a clear inverse relationship was established in the lateral direction upon examining the variable correlations.The presence of high or low foot arches did not significantly impact the activity of the muscles responsible for maintaining the body's center of gravity or postural stability among university-level athletes. This suggests the existence of neuromuscular compensation mechanisms that attempt to restore balance and compensate for any changes in postural stability caused by varying foot types. Through targeted training that emphasizes activation of the internal oblique muscle, athletes may see improved postural stability. Our findings indicate that static stabilization exercises can also prove beneficial in improving dynamic stability in the anteroposterior plane, while a more dynamic approach may be required to improve dynamic stability in the lateral plane.",

          "abstract": "The aim of our study is to examine the changes in core muscle functions during pregnancy.Our study was carried out in 67 primigravida pregnant women. Superficial electromyography (EMG) and non-invasive 2D/3D ultrasonography (USG) were used to evaluate core muscle (diaphragm, transversus abdominus [TA], internal oblique [IO]-external oblique [EO] muscles, pelvic floor muscles, multifidus) function during pregnancy. Pelvic floor muscle strength was also measured by a digital palpation method (PERFECT system). USG was used to measure expected fetal weight and the diastasis recti (DR) distance. Mann-Whitney U test was used to show changes in trimesters in the core muscles, and Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship.In the third trimester, an nonsignificant increase in EMG parameters was observed in all of the core muscles. Although a statistically significant decrease was observed in muscle thickness values measured by EO and IO USG in the third trimester, DR was found to increase at all levels (p < 0.005). When we evaluated both trimesters and all pregnant women together, no relationship was found between all core muscles and pelvic floor muscles in the data evaluated by EMG and USG. We found a negative correlation in USG values between fetal weight and IO and the upper part of the rectus abdominus muscle, and a positive correlation between the EMG data of the EO and rectus abdominus muscles.In women, the coactivation relationship between the core muscles may disappear during pregnancy. As the trimesters progress during pregnancy, a decrease in thickness and an increase in muscle activity can be observed in the core muscles. Pregnant women can be given exercise training for core muscles for protection in both the prenatal and postnatal periods. But more research needs to be done.© 2023.

Load cells can be affixed to suspension training devices to measure force exerted through the straps during exercise. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between activity of the RA and ES to force measured through a load cell fixed to suspension straps during bilateral and unilateral suspended bridge exercises.Forty asymptomatic, active individuals completed a single laboratory visit.Participants completed 2 bilateral suspended bridges and 2 unilateral suspended bridges held to failure. Surface electromyography sensors were placed over the bilateral RA and ES to quantify muscle activity (% maximum voluntary isometric contraction). A load cell was affixed to the suspension straps to measure force exerted through the straps throughout the duration of the exercise. Pearson correlations were used to determine relationships between force and muscle activity of the RA and ES throughout exercise duration.Force was negatively related to RA muscle activity in bilateral suspended bridges (r = -.735 to -.842, P < .001) and unilateral suspended bridges (r = -.300 to -.707, P = .002 to <.001). Force had a positive relationship with ES muscle activity in bilateral suspended bridges (r = .689 to .791, P < .001) and unilateral suspended bridges (r = .418 to .448, P < .001).Suspended bridge exercises can be a valuable tool to target posterior abdominal musculature such as the ES to contribute to core stability and endurance.

This study aimed to understand the correlation between the post-partum inter-recti distance (IRD) and functional impairments associated with core instability, with the hypothesis that IRD could serve as a proxy for core instability symptoms and constitute a tool in decision-making for DRA treatment. Material and Methods: A cohort of post-partum women with abdominal core instability symptoms combined with DRA were studied. The size of IRD was measured with ultrasonography and cross-sectionally analysed against functional impairments registered with the self-report Disability Rating Index (DRI), which grades the ability to perform 12 different daily activities. Results: A total of 224 women were included in the study. In univariable analysis, IRD was associated with impairment of the activities running (p = 0.007), heavy work (p = 0.036) and exercise/sports (p = 0.047), but not with dressing, walking, sitting for long periods, standing bent over a sink, carrying a suitcase, making a bed, light manual labour or heavy lifting. No significant correlations were seen in the multivariable analysis when adjustments were made for BMI and parity. Conclusion: IRD and post-partum functional impairments had no significant correlation in multivariable analysis. The post-partum core instability condition is complex and probably associated with more factors than solely the IRD. The IRD alone does not seem to be a sufficient proxy for decision-making regarding optimal treatment. A more complete instrument to assess the post-partum abdominal core is warranted.Copyright © 2022 Bixo, Sandblom, Österberg, Stackelberg, Bewö and Olsson.",

          "abstract": "The three-dimensional movement of the horse in physical therapy is a valuable kinesio-therapeutic phenomenon that simultaneously affects several body systems, including particularly the neuromuscular system. However, the effects of equine-assisted services (EAS) on neuromuscular activation patterns in older adults have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a 10-weeks EAS program on trunk muscles in older adults who used a saddle and placed their feet in stirrups for the first 15 minutes and out of stirrups for the remaining 15 minutes of 30-minute EAS sessions. We gathered electromyographic (EMG) data of the trunk muscles five times each on the first, fifth, and 10th sessions: pre-EAS and post-EAS on a stationary horse and at 1-minute, 15-minutes, and 30-minutes on a horse in motion. Participants were 20 adults, aged 60-79 years. We analyzed normalized EMG data with 5 (session time) by 3 (session number) analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with repeated measures and with Bonferroni's testing (p ≤ .05). There was a significant difference over the number of interventions for the right thoracic paravertebral muscle (p = .025) and session time effect for the left trapezius (p = .042), right thoracic paravertebral (p < .001), right and left multifidus (p < .001), and right and left rectus abdominis muscles (p < .001). Thus, trunk muscles in older adults showed complex neuromuscular activation synchronized with the horse's movement, which was influenced by session time and number of interventions. The practical implication of these findings is that EAS can reduce fall risk among elderly adults of both sexes.",

This study investigated whether the use of a suspension trainer increases core musculature co-activation during exercises vs. its floor counterpart. Participants were 25 healthy volunteers (16 men, 9 women; age: 27.24 ± 4.02 years). Wireless electromyography electrodes were placed bilaterally at the rectus abdominis (RA), erector spinae (ES), and abdominal obliques (OB). Test order (push-up, bridge, and prone plank) was randomized (exercise and condition) with a 3-min rest period between tests. Co-contraction ratios between muscle groups were estimated by root mean square. Ratios (RA/ES, RA/OB, ES/OB) were analyzed using paired t-tests (P ≤ .05). For all floor exercises, co-contraction of core musculature was significantly higher than suspension trainer. During suspension training, perturbations due to increased agonist activation without similar increases in antagonists may be too intense for untrained or injured individuals.

Thirty healthy subjects who participated in this study underwent ADIM and MACM three times in random order. We measured the abdominal muscle thickness during ADIM and MACM using ultrasonography and compared the changes in the thickness of TrA, IO, EO, and RA muscles using a paired t-test. Significant differences were observed in the thicknesses of all the abdominal muscles between the ADIM and MACM groups (p < 0.05). The MACM immediately increased the thickness of the TrA (p < 0.001, effect size (ES) = 0.931), IO (p = 0.001, ES = 0.761), EO (p = 0.008, ES = 0.415), and RA (p < 0.001, ES = 0.767) muscles.

          "abstract": "The objective of the current investigation was to evaluate the feasibility of a core-strengthening program delivered to a chronic stroke participant using a novel robotic device, AllCore360°, which targets trunk muscles through a systematic, consistent, high-intensity exercise. A 58-year old male with hemiplegia post stroke (time since injury: 18 years) was enrolled and performed 12-sessions of the core-strengthening program on AllCore360°. The participant completed a total of 142 360°-rotating-planks (called as 'spins') at four inclination angles, over 12 sessions. Assessments at baseline and follow up included posturography during quiet standing, electromyography (EMG) during AllCore360° spins, and assessments for trunk function (Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS)), balance (Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and mobility (Timed-Up and Go (TUG), 10-meter Walk test (10MWT), 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT)). Clinically meaningful improvements were observed in the TIS (73%), the BBS (45.2%), and the TUG test (22.7%). Medial-lateral Center of Pressure (MLCoP) data showed reduced RMS and range by 32.3% and 29.2%, respectively. EMG data from left and right rectus abdominis (RAB) muscles showed increased levels of activations for both inclination angles, 65° (LRAB: 74%, RRAB: 48.4%) and 55° (LRAB: 22.3%, RRAB: 28.7%). The participant rated the core-strengthening program 71 (scale: 0-126) on Physical ACtivity Enjoyment Scale at the follow up, showing a high level of satisfaction and engagement toward the training program. The preliminary results suggest that the novel robotic design and enhanced engagement of neuromuscular mechanisms features of AllCore360° core-strengthening program could facilitate improvements in trunk function, balance and mobility post stroke. A study with a large sample and an appropriate control group needs to be performed in the future.Clinical Relevance- The majority of clinical programs include core-stability exercises for improving trunk function.

This study aimed to quantify changes in muscle activation at a walk and trot in horses traveling over eight consecutive ground poles evenly spaced (at 30 inches for walk and 48 inches for trot) in parallel fashion in a straight line, and with hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands applied at 25% stretch. Surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected for the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles in six horses. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was performed for each muscle to test for significant differences in differences in normalized average rectified values and maximum low pass signals. Within subject effects were reported, followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons to evaluate differences between the conditions of with or without ground poles or elastic resistance bands. The use of ground poles at a walk resulted in a significant (p < .05) increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles, with an increase in the average rectified value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles and right longissimus dorsi muscle. The use of ground poles at a trot resulted in a significant increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles. The hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands resulted in a respective 27% and 27.2% increase in the mean average rectified value of the left and right RA muscles; however this only reached statistical significance in the left RA (p < .05). These findings provide support regarding changes in muscle activation when using ground poles to increase core and epaxial muscle engagement.

Thirty-two men with disk herniation participated in this clinical trial study which was randomly divided into three groups of suspension exercises (n: 12, age: 34.25 ± 8.81, BMI: 24.01 ± 2.7), core stability exercises (n: 10, age: 35 ± 10.3, BMI: 25 ± 2.27) and control (n: 10, age: 34.4 ± 6.67, BMI: 23.76 ± 1.45). Electrical activity of rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique and erector spinae muscles was masured by superficial EMG, back pain by McGill Pain Questionnaire and range of motion by Modified Schober test, one day before and immediately after of intervention period. The experimental groups performed an 8-week training period while the control group was only followed up. Data were analyzed using paired sample t test and analysis of covariance test and statistical significance was set at 0.05. Suspension group showed significant improvement in EMG of rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique muscles (respectively, p = 0.030, p = 0.017, p = 0.022) and pain (p = 0.001) compared to core stability group; but there was no significant difference between two groups in EMG of erector spinae muscle and range of motion. Changes in both training groups were significant in all variables compared to control groups (p ˂ 0.05). Our findings showed that although both exercises were effective in patients with lumbar disk herniation, but the effectiveness of suspension exercises in increasing muscle activation and reducing pain was more pronounced than core stability exercises.

The sEMG signals of deltoid, erector spines (ES), multifidus (MF), rectus abdominis (RA), and transversus abdominus/internal oblique muscles (TrA/IO) were recorded before and after the intervention in the weight-shifting task. The relative activation time of each muscle was calculated.In the WBV group, the relative activation time of bilateral MF and bilateral TrA/IO was significantly reduced on shoulder flexion (right MF: P=0.014; left MF: P=0.011; right TrA/IO: P=0.008; left TrA/IO: P=0.026). As for shoulder abduction, except for the left TrA/IO and the left RA, the relative activation time of other muscles was significantly reduced (right ES: P=0.001; left ES: P 0.05).WBV exercise can effectively alleviate the anticipatory delay of core muscles in NSLBP patients, but the long-term effects still need further study.

          "title": "The male rectus diastasis: a different concept?",
          "abstract": "More interest in the treatment of rectus diastasis has been evoked lately. Following the postpartum females from a great distance, the middle-aged males living with obesity are the second most common group of rectus diastasis patients. Although gender differences are considered frequently in regard to cosmetic appearance and symptoms, it is less obvious in classifications and subsequent treatment strategies. Is a unisex approach of rectus diastasis still applicable? The lack of a firm answer warrants this review of the current literature.An explorative free-text multi-database bibliographic search (Pubmed/CENTRAL/EMBASE/PEDro/Scholar) was performed with the focus on the rectus diastasis in males. Anticipating the limited references, the design was a non-systematic review. All studies, regardless of study type, language or time period, describing etiology, symptoms, classification and/or treatment options were eligible for inclusion. From the articles retrieved out of this search, additional references were identified by a manual search among the cited references.The multi-database search resulted in a total of 7633 records. Based on the title and abstract 95 records were full text assessed for eligibility. Eleven studies were identified as relevant, six by cross-reference and another four by hand-search were added to provide an insight in gender-specific aspects in rectus diastase. Hereditary causes are differences in collagen-like composition of types and concomitant abdominal aneurysm as well as gender differences in the linea alba architecture. Acquired etiology is distributed into both absolute pressure by visceral obesity and relative pressure caused by weight lifting or improper exercises. Furthermore, the impact of muscle thickness and age are considered as influencers of biomechanics. Gender differences can also play a role in symptoms of body image and core stability. It is known that there are anatomical differences between male and female persons; more transverse fibers are found in infra-umbilical region in women. In classifications the awareness of male rectus diastasis is limited, treatment outcome studies are scarce on males.An overview of male-specific aspects of rectus diastasis is provided, underlining that key aspects surrounding rectus diastasis in males differ from females. Although males are the minority of rectus diastasis patients, we recommend that the male rectus diastasis as a concept should be specifically acknowledged in classifications systems and study outcome reporting to evaluate this subgroup more accurately in the future.© 2021.

Repeated measures analysis of covariance examined Group x Time changes in width of DRA, core function, and weight at 12-weeks; effect sizes (i.e. Cohen's d) were calculated. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. There was a significant Group x Time interaction for two DRA width measurement sites, 2 inches above navel (rest) (p = 0.007, d = 0.67) and 2 inches above navel (active) (p = 0.005, d = 0.69).

Participants performed the PBT and SUBT in association with muscle recruitment, through surface electromyography of the upper and lower limbs and trunk muscles. The order of the tests was random and the participants performed one repetition of each test until fatigue. After a 30-min rest interval the participants repeated the tests. After one week, the participants returned and repeated the tests.The resistance group (RG) presented longer PBT holding time (RG 111.8 ± 9.4 and sedentary group (SG) 81 ± 7.7; p = 0.01), while the holding time in the SUBT was similar for both groups (RG = 100.7 ± 8.1 and SG = 79 ± 9.2; p = 0.09). Good to excellent reliability (ICC >0.836; SEM < 3.85) was established for the PBT and SUBT. Comparing the two groups there were no significant differences or interactions regarding muscle fatigue. The intragroup analysis on the PBT indicated greater gluteus maximus muscle fatigue, and for the SUBT the rectus abdominis presented greater fatigue, in both groups.The PBT and SUBT are reliable.

However, it has not been determined whether MACM is more effective and efficient than the maximal expiration method. Thus, the present study was undertaken to investigate whole abdominal muscle thickness changes after MACM. Materials and Methods: Thirty healthy subjects (17 males and 13 females) participated in this study. An experimental comparison between MACM and the maximal expiration task was conducted by measuring the change of abdominal muscle thickness such as the transverse abdominis (TrA), internal oblique (IO), external oblique (EO) and rectus abdominis (RA) using ultrasound images. Results: The results indicated that MACM resulted in significantly greater muscle thickness increases of the TrA and RA than the maximal expiration exercise (p < 0.05).

          "abstract": "This cross-sectional study of repeated measures investigated whether integrating the abdominal hollowing maneuver (AHM) into the prone plank performance is an effective strategy for increasing both the activation of the deep and superficial core musculature. Electromyographical (EMG) responses of rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and lumbar erector spinae (LES), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) of 20 participants (13 male, 7 female; mean ± standard deviation (SD) age: 24.25 ± 3.54 years; body mass: 66.42 ± 8.40 kg; height: 1.70 ± 9.51 m) were compared across two experimental conditions: the traditional prone plank (STANDARD); and a variation including the AHM (HOLLOWING). Regarding Total Intensity, HOLLOWING resulted in significantly greater EMG response than STANDARD (p < 0.001; Effect size (ES) = 3.01). Specifically, RA showed no significant differences between STANDARD and HOLLOWING (p = 0.056; ES = 0.285). However, for the remaining analyzed muscles, HOLLOWING significantly provided higher EMG activation compared to STANDARD (LES: p = 0.004; ES = 0.619; left EO: p < 0.001; ES = 1.031; right EO: p < 0.001; ES = 1.419; left IO: p < 0.001; ES = 2.021; right IO: p < 0.001; ES = 2.269). Regarding RPE, HOLLOWING reported values significantly greater than STANDARD (p < 0.001; ES = 2.94). In conclusion, integrating the AHM into the prone plank exercise enhances overall abdominal activity, particularly in both obliques. These findings provide updated guidelines for lumbar stabilization and core strengthening in health-related physical fitness programs.",

However, validation studies on the Sahrmann protocol are limited.The purpose of this study was to compare the different levels of Sahrmann five-level core stability (levels 1-5) on the muscle activity of rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), and transverse abdominis/internal oblique (TrA/IO).Twenty-two asymptomatic male participants aged 21.3 6 ± 1 .59 years were recruited. Participants were instructed to perform maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and five levels of Sahrmann five-level core stability test guided with a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU). The surface electromyography (EMG) data of each muscle during five levels of Sahrmann five-level core stability test were normalized as a percentage of MVC.Results showed significant differences in the normalized EMGs of RA [ χ 2 (4) = 64.80, p < 0 .001], EO [ χ 2 (4) = 58.11, p < 0 .001], and TrA/IO [ χ 2 (4) = 56.00, p < 0 .001] between the five levels of Sahrmann five-level core stability test. Post-hoc analysis revealed Sahrmann levels 5 and 3 have significantly higher abdominal EMG signals than levels 4, 2, and 1 ( p < 0 .001).In conclusion, the Sahrmann five-level core stability test differs according to the level of Sahrmann tests. Significantly higher abdominal muscle activities were observed during levels 3 and 5.

Participants performed functional movement screening (FMS) tests and six Pilates exercises at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Surface electromyography (EMG) was utilized to measure muscle activity at four sites: right rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), multifidus (MU), and longissimus (LO). Mean EMG activity, co-contraction indices, and duration of core muscle activation were analyzed using independent t-tests to examine the differences between groups. Cohen's d was used to calculate effect sizes based on the standard deviations of the groups. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The experienced practitioners scored significantly higher in total FMS scores and in four sub-units of the FMS scores compared to the novice group (p ≤ 0.01). Mean EO EMG activity was also significantly greater in experienced practitioners during all Pilates exercises (p < 0.05). Additionally, the RA/EO co-contraction index was higher in experienced practitioners during the 'double leg stretch' exercise (p = 0.02).The results suggest that experienced Pilates practitioners have superior functional movement abilities and greater core muscle activation, particularly in the EO muscle group, compared to novice practitioners.

The aim of this study was to analyze the acute effects on the recruitment of core muscles during two Pilates exercises, a single leg stretch (SL) and single straight leg stretch (SS), on the ground and using a FR as an unstable surface. Thirty women aged between 25 and 35 years old who had not previously practiced Pilates participated in this study. Surface EMG signals were collected from rectus abdominis (RA) and external oblique (EO) muscles during an isometric contraction lasting 30 s during the exercises. Two-factor Repeated Measures ANOVA tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons were used to investigate the muscle activity between the two stretching exercises when performed on the ground and using the FR. No significant interaction effects were seen between the two exercises and positions, and no main effects were seen for either factor.

The G values of some limb muscles were measured in relaxed and stretched positions.Regarding the effect of age on G at the distinct positions, the G of the upper limb muscles were not significantly correlated with age in the relaxed and stretched positions. In contrast, the G of the iliacus showed a significant negative correlation in both positions. Additionally, the G of the rectus femoris had a significant negative correlation only in the relaxed position. Regarding differences among body parts, the G of the lower limb and oblique abdominal muscles showed a significant negative correlation, but no correlation in the upper limb, rectus abdominis, and back muscles. Moreover, MT showed a significant negative correlation with age in the lower limb, abdominal, and erector spinae muscles, but no correlation was detected in the upper limb and lumbar multifidus muscles. EI had a significant positive correlation in all the muscles.The effect of age on G depended on body parts, and the G of the lower limb and oblique abdominal muscles negatively associated with age. Additionally, G in the relaxed position may be more susceptible to aging than G in the stretched position.© 2022.

          "abstract": "Pilates is an effective exercise method for rehabilitating musculoskeletal disorders as its principles are based on the activation of local muscles. This study aimed to compare the subjects with and without Pilates experience to find out the effect of the experience on the core muscle activity and muscle co-contraction, and to examine the relationship between the core muscle activation level and the kinematic data. This study involved 32 subjects, including 16 experienced Pilates practitioners and 16 non-experienced subjects. The knee stretch on the reformer was performed in three different positions: flat back with a neutral pelvis, round back with posteriorly tilted pelvis (RPP), and extended back anteriorly tilted pelvis (EAP). The electromyography of the internal oblique (IO), rectus abdominis (RA), multifidus (MU), and iliocostalis lumborum (IL) muscles were measured, as well as kinematic data from a 3D motion analysis system. Compared to the non-experienced subjects, the experienced subjects activated the IO muscles more than the RA muscles, and the most significant difference was seen in the RPP position (p < 0.05). The experienced patients activated the MU muscles more often than the IL muscles, with the most significant difference observed in the RPP position and the least significant in the EAP position (p < 0.05). All kinematic data and muscle activity (IO, IO/RA ratio, MU/IL ratio) showed significant differences between the experienced and non-experienced subjects (p < 0.05). The subjects presented a moderate correlation between muscle activation and core stability. It was confirmed that the experienced Pilates practitioners activated the abdominal and low back core muscles effectively, and the stability of the pelvis and trunk were better than that of the non-experienced participants. In addition, the better the trunk stability was maintained, the larger and more accurate movement of the mobility segment was observed.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the length of the LA and the engagement of TrA, EO and IO when performing the prone plank, bird dog, dead bug, lateral plank, glute bridge and hip extension.Thirteen apparently healthy participants volunteered to this study. Ultrasound scanning of the anterior and antero-lateral abdominal walls at baseline and whilst performing prone plank, bird dog, dead bug, lateral plank, glute bridge and hip extension exercises was performed. LA length and thickness of the TrA, EO and IO were measured from ultrasound images.LA length (p = 0.77) and TrA thickness (p = 0.23) were not different between exercises. EO thickness was larger for the lateral plank compared to the bird dog (p = 0.01, d = 1.73), glute bridge (p < 0.01, d = 2.64), and hip extension (p < 0.01, d = 1.89). The dead bug was also larger in comparison to the glute bridge (p < 0.01, d = 2.05) and to the hip extension (p = 0.01, d = 1.45).

          "abstract": "Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy gradually lose the ability to use different muscles of their body. Consequently, they lose the ability to stabilize their trunk against gravity. This hinders them to effectively perform different daily activities. In this paper, we describe the design, realization and evaluation of a trunk orthosis for these patients that should allow them to move their trunk and maintain stability.This study aimed to primarily assess the effectiveness of the trunk support system in terms of unloading of trunk muscles, so only healthy participants were recruited for this phase of the study. Measurements were done on 10 healthy participants (23.4±2.07 [M±SD] years old, average body weight 68.42±24.22 [M±SD] kg). The experiment comprised maintaining a constant trunk posture in three different device conditions (control without orthosis and two conditions with different configurations of the orthosis), at four different flexion angles (10°, 20°, 30°, 40°) for each device condition and for two load conditions (with and without stretching the arms). Electromyography (EMG) signals from the trunk muscles were measured to estimate activation levels of the trunk muscles (iliocostalis, longissimus, external oblique and rectus abdominis) and a motion capture system was used to record the movement of the participants during the experiment.Wearing the orthosis caused reductions in longissimus and iliocostalis activity. The average muscle activity level was 5%-10% of maximum voluntary contraction in the unsupported conditions for those particular muscles. This level was reduced to 3%-9% of maximal voluntary contraction for the supported conditions. No effect on external oblique and rectus abdominis activity was observed. Moreover, no pain or discomfort was reported by any of the participants during the experiment. The results from the current experiment also suggests the necessity of lumber stabilizing systems while using trunk orthosis.The developed orthosis reduces trunk muscle activation level and provides a solid step for further development of support systems for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.The current study was approved by the medical ethics committee Arnhem-Nijmegen (study number: NL53143.091.15 ), The Netherlands.",

          "abstract": "Visual spatial attention is a critical process that allows for the selection and enhanced processing of relevant objects and locations. While studies have shown attentional modulations of perceived location and the representation of distance information across multiple objects, there remains disagreement regarding what influence spatial attention has on the underlying structure of visual space. The present study utilized a method of magnitude estimation in which participants must judge the location of briefly presented targets within the boundaries of their individual visual fields in the absence of any other objects or boundaries. Spatial uncertainty of target locations was used to assess perceived locations across distributed and focused attention conditions without the use of external stimuli, such as visual cues. Across two experiments we tested locations along the cardinal and 45° oblique axes. We demonstrate that focusing attention within a region of space can expand the perceived size of visual space; even in cases where doing so makes performance less accurate. Moreover, the results of the present studies show that when fixation is actively maintained, focusing attention along a visual axis leads to an asymmetrical stretching of visual space that is predominantly focused across the central half of the visual field, consistent with an expansive gradient along the focus of voluntary attention. These results demonstrate that focusing sustained attention peripherally during active fixation leads to an asymmetrical expansion of visual space within the central visual field.Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Nanomaterials serve as promising candidates for strain sensing due to unique electromechanical properties by appropriately assembling and tailoring their configurations. Through the crisscross interlacing of graphene microribbons in an over-and-under fashion, the obtained graphene woven fabric (GWF) indicates a good trade-off between sensitivity and stretchability compared with those in previous studies. In this work, the function of woven fabrics for highly sensitive strain sensing is investigated, although network configuration is always a strategy to retain resistance stability. The experimental and simulation results indicate that the ultrahigh mechanosensitivity with gauge factors of 500 under 2% strain is attributed to the macro-woven-fabric geometrical conformation of graphene, which induces a large interfacial resistance between the interlaced ribbons and the formation of microscale-controllable, locally oriented zigzag cracks near the crossover location, both of which have a synergistic effect on improving sensitivity. Meanwhile, the stretchability of the GWF could be tailored to as high as over 40% strain by adjusting graphene growth parameters and adopting oblique angle direction stretching simultaneously. We also demonstrate that sensors based on GWFs are applicable to human motion detection, sound signal acquisition, and spatially resolved monitoring of external stress distribution.",

Simultaneous recordings of airflow, diaphragmatic (DIA) and oblique abdominal muscle (ABD) activities were performed in anesthetized (urethane, 1.2g/kg), tracheostomized, spontaneously breathing male Wistar rats (290-320g, n=12). The animals were exposed to hypercapnia (7 and 10% CO2 for 5min) and hypoxia (7% O2 for 1min) before and after bilateral vagotomy. We verified that the percentage increase in DIA burst amplitude elicited by hypercapnia and hypoxia episodes was similar between intact and vagotomized rats (P>0.05). In contrast, hypercapnia and hypoxia promoted a marked increase in ABD activity in vagotomized, but not in intact rats (P<0.01). These amplified expiratory motor changes after vagotomy were associated with enhanced expiratory airflow (P<0.01) and augmented tidal volume responses (P<0.01). Our data indicates that, in anesthetized conditions, the removal of peripheral afferent inputs facilitates the processing of active expiration in response to hypercapnia and hypoxia in rats.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-five resistance trained women with 4.6 ± 2.1 years of resistance training experience participated in the study. In randomized order, the participants performed 6 repetition maximum in free-weight squats, with and without elastic bands (i.e., matched relative intensity between exercises). During free-weight squats with elastic bands, some of the free weights were replaced with 2 elastic bands attached to the lowest part of the squat rack. Surface electromyography (EMG) activity was measured from the erector spinae, external oblique, and rectus abdominis, whereas a linear encoder measured the vertical displacement. The EMG activities were compared between the 2 lifting modalities for the whole repetition and separately for the eccentric, concentric, and upper and lower eccentric and concentric phases. In the upper (greatest stretch of the elastic band), middle, and lower positions in squats with elastic bands, the resistance values were approximately 117, 105, and 93% of the free weight-only trial. Similar EMG activities were observed for the 2 lifting modalities for the erector spinae (p = 0.112-0.782), external oblique (p = 0.225-0.977), and rectus abdominis (p = 0.315-0.729) in all analyzed phases.

          "abstract": "This paper reviews the functional anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which has a parallel array of collagen fascicles that have usually been divided into two 'fibre bundles': anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL), according to their tibial attachment sites. The PL bundle has shorter fibres, and so it is subjected to greater tensile strains than the AM bundle when the whole ACL is stretched; its oblique orientation in the coronal plane imbues it with greater ability to resist tibial rotation than the more vertical AM fibre bundle. Most studies have found that the AM bundle is close to isometric when the knee flexes, while the PL bundle slackens approximately 6 mm. There is little evidence of significant fibre bundle elongation in response to tibial rotation. Selective bundle cutting studies have been performed, allowing both the bundle tensions and their contributions to resisting tibial anterior translation and tibial rotation to be calculated. These show that the function of the PL bundle was dominant near knee extension in some studies, particularly when resisting anterior drawer and that its contribution reduced rapidly with knee flexion through 30 degrees. There has been little study of the contributions of the fibre bundles in control of tibial internal-external rotation or the pivot shift: one study found that the AM bundle had larger tensions than the PL bundle during a simulated pivot shift, but another study found that cutting the PL bundle allowed a larger increase in coupled tibial anterior translation than cutting the AM bundle. It was concluded that the AM bundle is most important for resisting tibial anterior drawer-the primary function of the ACL-while the PL bundle is tight near knee extension, when it has a role in control of tibial rotational laxity. There is a clear need for further study of dynamic knee instability, to gain better understanding of how best to reconstruct the ACL and associated tissues.",

          "abstract": "Abdominal wall muscles have a unique morphology suggesting a complex role in generating and transferring force to the spinal column. Studying passive mechanical properties of these muscles may provide insights into their ability to transfer force among structures. Biopsies from rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and transverse abdominis (TrA) were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats, and single muscle fibers and fiber bundles (4-8 fibers ensheathed in their connective tissue matrix) were isolated and mechanically stretched in a passive state. Slack sarcomere lengths were measured and elastic moduli were calculated from stress-strain data. Titin molecular mass was also measured from single muscle fibers. No significant differences were found among the four abdominal wall muscles in terms of slack sarcomere length or elastic modulus. Interestingly, across all four muscles, slack sarcomere lengths were quite long in individual muscle fibers (>2.4 µm), and demonstrated a significantly longer slack length in comparison to fiber bundles (p < 0.0001). Also, the extracellular connective tissue matrix provided a stiffening effect and enhanced the resistance to lengthening at long muscle lengths. Titin molecular mass was significantly less in TrA compared to each of the other three muscles (p < 0.0009), but this difference did not correspond to hypothesized differences in stiffness.Copyright © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.",

          "title": "Strain rate does not affect cortical microtubule orientation in the isolated epidermis of sunflower hypocotyls.",
          "abstract": "A hypothesis exists that external and internal factors affect the orientation of cortical microtubules in as much as these lead to changes in cell elongation rate. Factors that stimulate elongation are proposed to lead to transverse microtubule orientation, whereas factors that inhibit elongation lead to longitudinal orientation. The elongation rate is equal to the rate of longitudinal irreversible strain in cell walls. Incubated epidermis peeled from sunflower hypocotyls does not extend unless it is stretched by loading and the pH of the incubation medium is appropriately low. Thus, peels provide a convenient model to investigate the relationship between longitudinal strain rate and cortical microtubule orientation. In the present study, it was found that peeling affects microtubule orientation. Peels were incubated for several hours in Murashige & Skoog medium (both unbuffered and buffered) to attain a steady state of microtubule orientation before loading. The effects of loading and pH on strain rate and orientation of microtubules under the outer epidermal walls were examined in three portions of peels positioned with respect to the cotyledonary node. Appropriate loading caused longitudinal strain of peels at pH 4.5 but not at pH 6.5. However, no clear effect of strain rate on microtubule orientation in the peels was observed. Independent of applied load and pH of the incubation medium, the microtubule orientation remained unchanged, i.e. orientation was mainly oblique. Our results show that strain rate does not affect cortical microtubule orientation in isolated epidermis of the sunflower hypocotyl model system, although orientation could be changed by white light.",

          "title": "An anterior cervical retractor utilizing a novel principle.",
          "abstract": "The alarmingly high soft-tissue complication rates after anterior cervical surgery suggests that the design of current retractors is inadequate. A review of retractor design and consideration of new designs is worthwhile. The author reviewed the literature and the 7 described devices (Cloward, Caspar, Thompson-Farley, Tresserras, Ozer, Takayasu, and Oh devices). With the exception of Cloward/Caspar and Thomson-Farley systems, the author's search of the literature failed to disclose any independent review or investigations of the other retractors, suggesting that the use of these devices is limited. The Cloward/Caspar-style retractors depend for stability on small teeth at the ends of the blades that impale and stretch the longus colli muscle. For stability this self-retaining design requires equal tissue counterpressure. These devices are thus ill suited for a wound with substantially greater pressure from the medial structures and are prone to migration. The Thomson-Farley type of systems use arms with mechanical joints fixed to a table-mounted frame. The releasable joints allow adjustability and independent relaxation. Their limitations include bulk causing obstruction to the surgeons and radiographs, increased setup time, and ease with which excessive force can be applied. The author describes a new anterior cervical retractor that is based on a novel principle. The principle is that bone fixation can be used to provide the retractor blade an axis of rotation inside the wound. This gives improved retractor blade stability with the mechanical advantage of a lever. The stable rotation produced allows adjustable retraction and tissue relaxation without compromise in stability. To the author's knowledge, there are no previously described retractors with this ability. The system consists of a small 2-piece sliding frame fixed to the spine with the distraction screws. Bone fixation is preferable to sharp teeth and longus colli dissection because it works better and heals without scarring. Surgery is carried out through the frame, which slides during distraction. Independent retractor blades are attached to the sides of the frame, which provides a stable craniocaudal axis inside the wound. The blades rotate to provide retraction or relaxation as required. Intermittent relaxation of tissues under retractors has been shown to be beneficial. Another advantage, compared with systems that maintain wounds with vertical sides, is the ease with which an oblique approach can be used. The mechanical advantage has 3 benefits. First, bulky external mechanisms for retraction are avoided, which improves access. Second, numerous blade lengths are unnecessary, reducing inventory. Third, radiolucent polymers can be used with \"snap-fit\" properties. The improved stability over conventional systems reduces the need for skilled assistance and avoids surgeon frustration after retraction migration. Over a 3-year period, 100 anterior cervical operations have been performed. Anecdotally, operations are quicker mainly because the retractors do not slip. Prospective clinical studies with independent evaluation are underway.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of posture on the expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles. Fifteen young adult men participated in the study. Activities of the external oblique abdominis, internal oblique abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles were measured electromyographically in various postures. We used a pressure threshold in order to activate the abdominal muscles as these muscles are silent at rest. A spirometer was used to measure the lung volume in various postures. Subjects were placed in the supine, standing, sitting, and sitting-with-elbow-on-the-knee (SEK) positions. Electromyographic activity and mouth pressure were measured during spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary ventilation under the respiratory load. We observed that the lung volume changed with posture; however, the breathing pattern under respiratory load did not change. During maximal voluntary ventilation, internal oblique abdominis muscle expiratory activity was lower in the SEK position than in any other position, external oblique abdominis muscle inspiratory activity was lower in the supine position than in any other position, and internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher in the standing position than in any other position. During spontaneous breathing, external oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during expiration and inspiration in the SEK position than in any other position. The internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during both inspiration and expiration in the standing position than in any other position. The rectus abdominis muscle activity did not change with changes in posture during both inspiration and expiration. Increase in the external oblique abdominis activity in the SEK position was due to anatomical muscle arrangement that was consistent with the direction of lower rib movement. On the other hand, increase in the internal oblique abdominis activity in the standing position was due to stretching of the abdominal wall by the viscera. We concluded that differences in activity were due to differences in the anatomy of the abdominal muscles and the influence of gravity.",

Reflex responses of the following abdominal muscles were investigated both ipsilateral and contralateral to the tap: rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO) and internal oblique (IO). Reflexes were evoked in each of the homonymous muscles with latencies and estimated conduction velocities compatible with being evoked by Ia muscle afferents and having a monosynaptic component. Short latency heteronymous excitatory reflex connections were also observed in muscles on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides in response to the same stimulus. The latencies of the crossed responses were only marginally longer than responses evoked in the respective ipsilateral muscle. Moreover, the reflexes evoked in the IO muscle from ipsilateral and contralateral IO muscle afferents were of comparable amplitude, as were those reflexes evoked in ipsilateral and contralateral EO and RA muscles when tapping IO. These similarities in the reflex characteristics on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides suggest that abdominal muscle afferents activate similar pathways to muscles on both sides of the body. It follows that if the homonymous stretch reflex of abdominal muscles have a monosynaptic component, then a similar monosynaptic pathway activates synergistic motoneurones, not only ipsilaterally but also contralaterally.",

The neuronal mechanism of sciatic scoliosis has not been well clarified. Recently, prolonged alteration of motor function in the hindlimbs of animals caused by central sensitization has been reported.In spinalized rats (transection of the spinal cord), the sciatic nerve was stimulated electrically as a conditioning stimulus. Muscle stretch elicited by bending of the lumbar spine was applied as a test stimulus. Background and stretch reflex activities of the bilateral oblique abdominal, psoas, and quadratus lumborum muscles were recorded. Rats in which MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, was preadministered also were used.The conditioning stimulus enhanced background electromyographic activity in bilateral oblique abdominal, contralateral psoas, and quadratus lumborum muscles. Furthermore, the conditioning stimulus induced prolonged facilitation and depression of stretch reflex activity of the contralateral psoas and quadratus lumborum, and ipsilateral psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles, respectively. Preadministration of MK-801 reduced these excitatory and inhibitory effects.It was found that the pattern of electromyographic activity of the trunk muscles evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation coincided with the typical direction of sciatic scoliosis in patients with lumbar disc herniation. It was supposed that the prolonged asymmetric alteration of the trunk muscle tonus was caused by central sensitization, and that central sensitization of spinal neurons may underlie the neuronal mechanism of sciatic scoliosis.",

A major effect of spaceflight was an increase of 42-171% in fibers double-labeled for MHC in all three muscles. Based on fiber CSA, the TA and RA muscles showed signs of stretching with increased gestation; i.e., the CSA decreased 11-12% over a nine-day period. The EO, a torso rotator, hypertrophied by 9% in rats group-housed in cages with a complex 3-D structure, compared to controls housed singly in standard flat-bottom cages. The TA and EO, whose contractions would pull on the suture line, showed signs of atrophy in laparotomized animals, exhibiting a 12% decrease in muscle fiber CSA. Exposure to weightlessness is known to induce atrophy in most skeletal muscles. Surprisingly, the EO actually hypertrophied 11% in our flight animals; however, this can be explained by the fact that those rats actively rotated their torsos seven times more often than ground controls. The flight rats also had twice as many contractions as controls. However, they were still able to give birth on time postflight.Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The evaluation lead to their views regarding indications of different surgical techniques. In their opinion the best operation is triple partial myotomy of the inferior oblique muscle as it does not influence the horizontal position and preserves the original insertion of the muscle. They modify the techniques of Romer-Apis and Martinez-Oropeza. Fixation of the inferior and external rectus on hooks reveals the surgical field, and the concurrent stretching of the inferior oblique muscle beneath the conjunctiva facilitates its dissection. The authors include triple partial myotomy except for hypertropias in the comprehensive surgical procedure together with plication of the ipsilateral superior oblique muscle in paresis of the trochlear nerve. They indicate retroposition of the inferior oblique muscle only in divergence associated with hyperfunction of the inferior oblique muscle. The operation has a favourable effect on convergent synkinesis and enhances convergence by +2 to +5 degrees. The authors consider free myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle the least physiological operation and use it no longer.",

          "abstract": "We examined the contribution of afferent vagal A- and C-fibers on abdominal expiratory muscle activity (EMA). In seven spontaneously breathing supine dogs anesthetized with alpha-chloralose we recorded the electromyogram of the external oblique muscle at various vagal temperatures before and after the induction of a pneumothorax. When myelinated fibers were blocked selectively by cooling the vagus nerves to 7 degrees C, EMA decreased to 40% of control (EMA at 39 degrees C). With further cooling to 0 degrees C, removing afferent vagal C-fiber activity, EMA returned to 72% of control. On rewarming the vagus nerves to 39 degrees C, we then induced a pneumothorax (27 ml/kg) that eliminated the EMA in all the dogs studied. Cooling the vagus nerves to 7 degrees C, during the pneumothorax, produced a slight though not significant increase in EMA. However, further cooling of the vagus nerves to 0 degrees C caused the EMA to return vigorously to 116% of control. In three dogs, intravenous infusion of a constant incrementally increasing dose of capsaicin, a C-fiber stimulant, decreased EMA in proportion to the dose delivered. These results suggest that EMA is modulated by a balance between excitatory vagal A-fiber activity, most likely from slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors, and inhibitory C-fiber activity, most likely from lung C-fibers.",

In addition, we have related the lengths of these muscles measured sonometrically in vivo at supine functional residual capacity (FRC) to in vitro optimal force-producing length (Lo). We also investigated the action of the abdominal muscles on the displacement of costal and crural diaphragm. We found that 1) contraction time of RA was longer and that the RA developed greater force than the EO at submaximal stimulation frequencies; 2) maximal tetanic force and the active length-tension curves were similar in both abdominal muscles; 3) on passive stretch, the compliance of the RA was one-third that of the EO; 4) at supine FRC, the EO is operating at 83% of Lo, whereas the RA is operating at 105% of Lo; 5) stimulation of either RA or EO (abdominal pressure of 15 cmH2O) lengthened the costal and crural diaphragm toward their Lo values, with greater crural excursion occurring than costal.

          "abstract": "An electric shock delivered to a mixed intercostal nerve of a standing human subject evokes two responses in the external oblique abdominal EMG, namely an M-wave and an electrically elicited reflex. The reflex latency is very close to that of the mechanically elicited phasic stretch reflex of the external oblique, suggesting that it is a monosynaptic spinal reflex. However, several of its characteristics make it very different from the mechanically evoked reflex and the H-responses of calf or jaw muscles. Unlike the mechanically evoked reflex, the electrically elicited reflex is neither modulated by respiration nor attenuated when the subject assumes a supine posture. Unlike the H-response of calf or jaw muscles, the electrically elicited reflex is extremely reproducible from trial to trial, displays no antidromic occlusion in response to an increase in shock strength, and is neither suppressed nor potentiated by abdominal muscle vibration. A silent period, i.e., an indicator of alpha-motoneuron suppression, follows an electrically elicited reflex only when the subject rotates his trunk away from the recording site. Presumably, inputs from external oblique muscle receptors inhibit their homonymous motoneurons effectively when the muscle is functioning as the chief power generator, but not when it is functioning as an agonist. Using single motor unit analysis, the electrically elicited reflex was shown to be comprised of monosynaptic, oligosynaptic, and multisegmental components with the major component being monosynaptic. These unique characteristics of the EER are presumably a reflection of the external oblique's multisegmental innervation, multilayered anatomy, short neuronal pathways, and diverse functions.",

We recorded surface EMGs from the external and internal oblique muscles in standing subjects. Amplitudes of the abdominal stretch reflex varied despite constant tap forces, but strong taps evoked a larger reflex than weak taps. Trunk rotation toward the recording side, or voluntary contraction of the external and internal oblique muscles increased the reflex amplitudes, whereas contralateral rotation reduced their occurrence. An abdominal stretch reflex during a voluntary contraction was followed by a silent period of 40 to 80 ms. Often a late wave followed a reflex by 20 to 40 ms. Amplitudes during breathholds at residual lung volume were larger than those evoked during a breathhold at functional residual capacity, suggesting that abdominal stretch reflex amplitudes are inversely proportional to static lung volume. During quiet breathing the reflex amplitude reached a maximum slightly before end-expiration and decreased progressively to a minimum close to end-inspiration. During rebreathing, background abdominal activity was augmented with highest activity in late expiration. Abdominal stretch reflex amplitudes continued to wax and wane in phase with respiration, and the maximal reflex occurred progressively earlier in expiration. In summary, the abdominal stretch reflex reflects strong control from abdominal muscle spindles, lung proprioceptors, and chemoreceptors.

          "abstract": "1. We studied abdominal muscle responses to positive pressure loads applied suddenly to the external airway while subjects held a constant lung volume against steady pressure. The pre-loading holding pressure was 6 cm H(2)O, and the loading pressures were 6 or 12 cm H(2)O lasting for 2 sec.2. Surface electromyograms (e.m.g.) were recorded over the internal oblique, external oblique, and rectus abdominis muscles. The latency and pattern of the e.m.g. reactions were studied by measuring the raw record for each loading trial, and by averaging the rectified e.m.g. for many trials.3. No responses were obtained if subjects were instructed not to respond to the loads. When instructed and trained to maintain their pre-load position in spite of the load, a two-phase compensatory response was found. The initial response (phase I) was 100-300 msec in duration; it was followed by a continuous e.m.g. discharge (phase II) which continued to the offset of the pressure load. Subjects were also trained to make a single respiratory effort as quickly as possible after the load onset or after just an auditory stimulus. These were simple reaction time tasks of a traditional kind and the e.m.g. responses elicited were single, brief bursts.4. For all subjects and experimental conditions the e.m.g. response of the internal oblique occurred first, followed by the external oblique and then the rectus abdominis. For the ;maintain position' task, phase I latencies (internal oblique) averaged 66-90 msec for individual subjects, but for single trials with optimal conditions of practice and preparatory intervals these ranged from 42 to 110 msec with a third of the reactions occurring within 50-60 msec.5. The latencies for reaction time responses to loading were about 6 msec shorter than the phase I latencies. The latency distributions for the two types of responses were similar, and both were affected to the same degree by practice, and changing the length and variability of the preparatory interval. Because of these similarities we suggest that the phase I reaction was a learned response of a ;simple reaction time' type, and not comparable to late stretch reflexes such as the M2 of limb muscles.6. Arm muscle responses to respiratory pressure changes were measured in three subjects under identical conditions used to obtain load reaction times of abdominal muscles. These simple reaction times averaged 61-71 msec, and ranged from 42 to 97 msec. Therefore very short proprioceptive reaction times are not peculiar to the respiratory system, or to load perturbations of the responding muscle.7. Mechanical adjustments of airway pressure and lung volume in response to loading are first expressed at the mouth about 90 msec after abdominal muscle activity begins. In the ;maintain position' task, the accuracy with which pressure and volume adjustments were made during the last 1.5 sec of the loading period approximated that reported in the literature for trained singers holding a tone using constant expiratory pressure.",

The neuronal mechanism of sciatic scoliosis has not been well clarified. Recently, prolonged alteration of motor function in the hindlimbs of animals caused by central sensitization has been reported.In spinalized rats (transection of the spinal cord), the sciatic nerve was stimulated electrically as a conditioning stimulus. Muscle stretch elicited by bending of the lumbar spine was applied as a test stimulus. Background and stretch reflex activities of the bilateral oblique abdominal, psoas, and quadratus lumborum muscles were recorded. Rats in which MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, was preadministered also were used.The conditioning stimulus enhanced background electromyographic activity in bilateral oblique abdominal, contralateral psoas, and quadratus lumborum muscles. Furthermore, the conditioning stimulus induced prolonged facilitation and depression of stretch reflex activity of the contralateral psoas and quadratus lumborum, and ipsilateral psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles, respectively. Preadministration of MK-801 reduced these excitatory and inhibitory effects.It was found that the pattern of electromyographic activity of the trunk muscles evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation coincided with the typical direction of sciatic scoliosis in patients with lumbar disc herniation. It was supposed that the prolonged asymmetric alteration of the trunk muscle tonus was caused by central sensitization, and that central sensitization of spinal neurons may underlie the neuronal mechanism of sciatic scoliosis.",

          "abstract": "This analysis of the abdominal stretch reflex (ASR) evoked by a tap to the abdomen was designed to explore how abdominal motoneurons process signals from respiratory and nonrespiratory sources. We recorded surface EMGs from the external and internal oblique muscles in standing subjects. Amplitudes of the abdominal stretch reflex varied despite constant tap forces, but strong taps evoked a larger reflex than weak taps. Trunk rotation toward the recording side, or voluntary contraction of the external and internal oblique muscles increased the reflex amplitudes, whereas contralateral rotation reduced their occurrence. An abdominal stretch reflex during a voluntary contraction was followed by a silent period of 40 to 80 ms. Often a late wave followed a reflex by 20 to 40 ms. Amplitudes during breathholds at residual lung volume were larger than those evoked during a breathhold at functional residual capacity, suggesting that abdominal stretch reflex amplitudes are inversely proportional to static lung volume. During quiet breathing the reflex amplitude reached a maximum slightly before end-expiration and decreased progressively to a minimum close to end-inspiration. During rebreathing, background abdominal activity was augmented with highest activity in late expiration. Abdominal stretch reflex amplitudes continued to wax and wane in phase with respiration, and the maximal reflex occurred progressively earlier in expiration. In summary, the abdominal stretch reflex reflects strong control from abdominal muscle spindles, lung proprioceptors, and chemoreceptors. The relative contributions of these inputs need to be determined.",

The past several decades have seen a rise in research aimed at the anatomy and physiology of primate chewing muscles to better understand the functional and evolutionary significance of the primate masticatory apparatus. This review summarizes variation in jaw-adductor fiber types and muscle architecture in primates, focusing on physiological, architectural, and behavioral performance variables such as specific tension, fatigue resistance, muscle and bite force, and muscle stretch and gape. Paranthropus and Australopithecus are used as one paleontological example to showcase the importance of these data for addressing paleobiological questions.

No previous studies specifically analyzing severe adductor longus injury mechanisms using video analysis have been published.To systematically analyze video footage to describe the mechanisms of severe acute adductor longus injuries in male professional soccer players.Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.A total of 20 professional male soccer players (median age, 27 years; range, 18-35 years) who experienced an acute adductor longus injury during a match between October 2017 and December 2023 were included. All analyzed injuries were severe, either complete adductor longus tendon ruptures or partial lesions resulting in an absence from soccer competition of >28 days. Two authors independently reviewed the injuries based on a comprehensive injury causation model. Factors analyzed included playing situation, player/opponent behavior, and biomechanical descriptions encompassing whole-body and joint movements/positions.Of the 20 included injuries, 13 (65%) were considered noncontact and 7 (35%) were indirect contact. A closed kinetic chain (CKC) injury mechanism was found in 14 injuries (70%), an open kinetic chain (OKC) mechanism was found in 3 injuries (15%), and the injury occurred during high-speed running in the remaining 3 cases (15%). Player actions at the time of injury included reaching with the uninjured leg (CKC stretching; n = 11 [55%]), reaching with the injured leg (OKC stretching; n = 2 [10%]), dribbling (n = 2 [10%]), and landing (n = 2 [10%]). In CKC injuries, hip extension, hip abduction, and external rotation were all found in 64% of the cases. All OKC injuries involved hip abduction, external rotation, and rapid change of movement from hip extension to flexion.Severe adductor longus injuries occurred predominantly during CKC actions, particularly when reaching for the ball with the uninjured leg. These injuries were consistently characterized by a combination of hip extension, abduction, and external rotation. A crucial aspect in these injuries appears to be the involvement of an eccentric muscle action, featuring rapid muscle activation during rapid muscle lengthening.© The Author(s) 2025.",

          "abstract": "Groin pain is a common issue among athletes. Adductor-related pain is known as the most common cause of groin pain. Although, non-operative treatments have limited efficacy, Capacitive and Resistive Energy Transfer (TECAR), can be used in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. The objective of the present study is to explore the effect of TECAR therapy on pain, range of motion (ROM), strength, and subscales of the \"Copenhagen Thigh and Groin Assessment Scale\"(HAGOS) questionnaire in athletes suffering from adductor-related groin pain (ARGP).This study was a two arm parallel groups randomized sham-controlled superiority trial. A total of 22 male professional athletes (mean age 21.36 years) were randomly assigned to either the real TECAR therapy (n = 11) or sham TECAR therapy (n = 11) group, using block-balanced randomization. Both groups received stretching exercises. Intervention group received 10 sessions of TECAR therapy while, the control group received sham TECAR therapy. Primary outcome was pain that was measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included ROM, strength, and HAGOS questionnaire subscales. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 5 sessions, after 10 sessions, and one month after treatment. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Analysis of Covariance were used to compare between-group mean differences. P-value was set at 0.05. Effect size Cohen's d was also reported. This study took place from September 2022 to August 2023 at the Rehabilitation Clinic at Iran University of Medical Sciences.A total of 22 male athletes were included (11 in each group), with a mean age of 21.09 years in the TECAR group and 21.63 years in the sham group. TECAR therapy was associated with significant reductions in pain intensity across all evaluation sessions. Specifically, after 5 sessions, there was a large effect size for pain reduction (p = 0.01, Cohen's d = -1.09 [95% CI: -0.195 to -1.987]); after 10 sessions, the effect was even larger (p = 0.001, Cohen's d = -2.153 [95% CI: -1.103 to -3.203]); and at the 1-month follow-up, the pain reduction persisted (p = 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.96 [95% CI: -0.944 to -2.978]). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was a significant improvement in hip adduction ROM at the 1-month follow-up (p = 0.03, Cohen's d = 0.908 [95% CI: 0.03 to 1.78]). However, no statistically significant differences were found for other secondary outcomes, with effect sizes ranging from no effect to intermediate.The results of this study suggest that TECAR therapy may reduce pain and improve hip adduction range of motion in athletes with adductor-related groin pain.This trial was registered at the ( https://www.irct.ir ), (IRCT20220622055250N1) on 18/09/2022.© 2025.

          "abstract": "Although supervised exercise therapy (SET) is a primary treatment for peripheral artery disease (PAD), the current literature is limited regarding the mechanisms contributing to increased walking distances, including how lower extremity muscle function is altered after SET. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SET on lower extremity muscle function during walking in patients with PAD.Twelve patients with PAD participated in a 6-month SET program consisting of three weekly exercise sessions (a total of 72 sessions) and adhered to the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) recommendations. Each session started with a 5 min warm-up of mild walking and static stretching of upper and lower body muscles, followed by 50 min of intermitted exercise on a treadmill, and then finished with 5 min of cool-down activities similar to the warm-up. Each patient walked across a 10 m pathway with reflective markers on their lower limbs twice: before (baseline) and after six months of participation in SET (post-exercise). Marker coordinates and ground reaction forces were recorded and imported to OpenSim software (version 4.0) for gait simulations. Muscle force, muscle power, and metabolic rate were estimated from OpenSim and compared between the baseline and post-exercise.The mean plantar flexor force was not altered after SET. However, individuals' plantar flexor muscles demonstrated improvements in force production (lateral gastrocnemius: 75-80% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.43; medial gastrocnemius: 65-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.71; soleus: 90-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.26). Furthermore, plantar flexor power increased (80-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.39) and this was attributed to increased power in the lateral gastrocnemius (80-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47), medial gastrocnemius (80-90% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.22-0.60), and soleus muscles (85-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.49). Similarly, other muscle groups (knee extensors, knee flexors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip extensors, and hip flexors) also exhibited force and power increases after SET. Additionally, force and power variances were significantly decreased in several muscle groups (plantar flexors, knee extensors, hip abductors, hip external rotators, hip extensors, and hip flexors). Total metabolic rate also increased during the stance period where muscle force and power were elevated after SET (early stance: 5-25%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.82; mid stance: 35-45%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47; late stance: 75-80%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.36).Our results suggest that from a biomechanics perspective, muscle functions during walking are improved in patients with PAD after SET; however, the improvements were generally small and were not reflected by all muscle groups.",

          "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) describes some upper motoneuron disorders due to non-progressive disturbances occurring in the developing brain that cause progressive changes to muscle. While longer sarcomeres increase muscle stiffness in patients with CP compared to typically developing (TD) patients, changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture can increase stiffness. Our goal was to investigate how changes in muscle and ECM architecture impact muscle stiffness, gait and joint function in CP. Gracilis and adductor longus biopsies were collected from children with CP undergoing tendon lengthening surgery for hamstring and hip adduction contractures, respectively. Gracilis biopsies were collected from TD patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery with hamstring autograft. Muscle mechanical testing, two-photon imaging and hydroxyproline assay were performed on biopsies. Corresponding data were compared to radiographic hip displacement in CP adductors (CPA), gait kinematics in CP hamstrings (CPH), and joint range of motion in CPA and CPH. We found at matched sarcomere lengths muscle stiffness and collagen architecture were similar between TD and CP hamstrings. However, CPH stiffness (R2 = 0.1973), collagen content (R2 = 0.5099) and cross-linking (R2 = 0.3233) were correlated to decreased knee range of motion. Additionally, we observed collagen fibres within the muscle ECM increase alignment during muscular stretching. These data demonstrate that while ECM architecture is similar between TD and CP hamstrings, collagen fibres biomechanics are sensitive to muscle strain and may be altered at longer in vivo sarcomere lengths in CP muscle. Future studies could evaluate the impact of ECM architecture on TD and CP muscle stiffness across in vivo operating ranges. KEY POINTS: At matched sarcomere lengths, gracilis muscle mechanics and collagen architecture are similar in TD patients and patients with CP. In both TD and CP muscles, collagen fibres dynamically increase their alignment during muscle stretching. Aspects of muscle mechanics and collagen architecture are predictive of in vivo knee joint motion and radiographic hip displacement in patients with CP. Longer sarcomere lengths in CP muscle in vivo may alter collagen architecture and biomechanics to drive deficits in joint mobility and gait function.© 2024 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "Although stretching can acutely increase joint range of motion (ROM), there are a variety of factors which could influence the extent of stretch-induced flexibility such as participant characteristics, stretching intensities, durations, type (technique), and muscle or joint tested.The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the acute effects of stretching on ROM including moderating variables such as muscles tested, stretch techniques, intensity, sex, and trained state.A random-effect meta-analysis was performed from 47 eligible studies (110 effect sizes). A mixed-effect meta-analysis subgroup analysis was also performed on the moderating variables. A meta-regression was also performed between age and stretch duration.

While there were ROM increases with sit and reach (P = 0.038), hamstrings (P < 0.001), and triceps surae (P = 0.002) tests, there was no change with the hip adductor test (P = 0.403).

Video footage was obtained and three raters independently categorised injury mechanism and situational patterns using a standardised checklist. Injury epidemiology (month), timing of injuries within the match and location of injuries on the pitch were also examined.We identified 121 lower limb severe muscle injuries. Videos of sufficient quality were available for 103 (85%) cases, including 61 (60%) hamstring, 17 (16%) calf, 16 (15%) adductor and 9 (9%) quadricep muscle injuries. Nearly two-thirds of injuries involved the dominant/kicking leg (n=65, 63%). Eighty-five (83%) injuries were non-contact and 18 (17%) indirect contact. Four main situational patterns were identified and accounted for 88% of injuries: (1) running/acceleration (n=35, 34%); (2) closed kinetic chain stretching (n=21, 20%); (3) open kinetic chain stretching (n=19, 18%) and (4) kicking (n=16, 16%), with differences between muscle groups. 71% of injuries occurred in the first half of the match (p<0.01), with a gradual increase through the first half.Most severe muscle injuries during football matches were non-contact and occurred in the first half during running/acceleration, open and closed kinetic chain stretching, or kicking.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

          "abstract": "Groin pain syndrome (GPS) is a prevalent issue in soccer. This study assessed the effectiveness of a new preventive protocol on GPS for youth soccer players. The protocol included targeted stretching and strengthening exercises for the adductor and core muscles from preseason to midseason. A questionnaire and two pain provocation tests were used for the evaluation. Mild GPS required positive results in at least two evaluations, while severe GPS was associated with pain incompatible with engagement in any activity confirmed by diagnostic ultrasound. Forty-two elite male athletes (aged 16.9 ± 0.7 years) participated in the study, with half of them assigned to the usual training (control group) and the remaining athletes undergoing the preventive protocol (treatment group) for 24 weeks. GPS rates were 14.3% (three diagnoses: two mild, one severe) in the treatment group and 28.6% (six diagnoses: three mild, three severe) in the control group. Toward the end of the season, three players, one from the treatment group and two from the control group had to stop playing due to severe GPS problems. In addition, one player in the control group stopped midseason. Even though the reduction in the risk of developing GPS was not significant (relative risk of 0.50 ([95%CI 0.14 to 1.74], p = 0.2759), the halved incidence of severe GPS and the increased muscle strength related to the treatment (p = 0.0277) are encouraging data for future studies.",

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by the expansion of the first 10 alanine stretches. The only exception is the missense mutation of glycine at the 12th residue into alanine, which elongates the stretch to 13 alanines by connecting the first and second stretch with the addition of one alanine in between, indicating that the expansion or elongation of the alanine stretch results in OPMD. We report a 77-year-old man with the novel missense mutation c.34G > T (p.Gly12Trp) in PABPN1 gene whose clinicopathological findings were compatible with OPMD. He presented with slowly progressive bilateral ptosis, dysphagia, and symmetrical proximal dominant muscle weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed selective fat replacement of the tongue, bilateral adductor magnus, and soleus muscles. Immunohistochemistry studies of the muscle biopsy sample revealed PABPN1-posibive aggregates in the myonuclei which have been reported to be specific to OPMD. This is the first OPMD case caused by neither the expansion nor the elongation of alanine stretch.

There is growing evidence supporting the effectiveness of dry needling in abating spasticity.The present case aims to quantify the effects of dry needling on upper limb spastic muscles in a survivor of severe traumatic brain injury in a 27-year-old Iranian man. The treated muscles were biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, opponens pollicis, and adductor pollicis. Outcome measures were evaluated before and 1 hour after the intervention. Our results showed that the patient's upper limb recovery stage and hand function improved one grade according to Brunnstrom recovery stages. Spasticity assessed using the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale in all movements showed one-grade abatement, except in the forearm pronator. Passive resistance force decreased in all movements except in forearm supination. Active range of motion and passive range of motion increased in all movements except in active and passive forearm supination. Hand dexterity improved in both affected and unaffected hands.Results shown that dry needling could be a favorable option for reducing spasticity.© 2022. The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "We reviewed and appraised the existing evidence of in vivo manifestations of residual force enhancement in human skeletal muscles and assessed, through a meta-analysis, the effect of an immediate history of eccentric contraction on the subsequent torque capacity of voluntary and electrically evoked muscle contractions.Our search was conducted from database inception to May 2020. Descriptive information was extracted from, and quality was assessed for, 45 studies. Meta-analyses and metaregressions were used to analyze residual torque enhancement and its dependence on the angular amplitude of the preceding eccentric contraction.Procedures varied across studies with regards to muscle group tested, angular stretch amplitude, randomization of contractions, time window analyzed, and verbal command. Torque capacity in isometric (constant muscle tendon unit length and joint angle) contractions preceded by an eccentric contraction was typically greater compared to purely isometric contractions, and this effect was greater for electrically evoked muscle contractions than voluntary contractions. Residual torque enhancement differed across muscle groups for the voluntary contractions, with a significant enhancement in torque observed for the adductor pollicis, ankle dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, and knee extensors, but not for the elbow and knee flexors. Meta-regressions revealed that the angular amplitude of the eccentric contraction (normalized to the respective joint's full range of motion) was not associated with the residual torque enhancement observed.There is evidence of residual torque enhancement for most, but not all, muscle groups, and residual torque enhancement is greater for electrically evoked than for voluntary contractions. Contrary to our hypothesis, and contrary to generally accepted findings on isolated muscle preparations, residual torque enhancement in voluntary and electrically evoked contractions does not seem to depend on the angular amplitude of the preceding eccentric contraction.Copyright © 2021.

All athletes received a standardized clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blinded to clinical information. We analysed correlations between extent of palpation pain and extent of MRI oedema for the adductor longus. We compared the clinical assessment to MRI adductor injury grading (0-3) using ordinal regression. We analysed positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) of a complete adductor longus avulsion.Proximal-distal length of adductor longus palpation pain had fair correlation with MRI proximal-distal oedema length oedema (r=0.309, p=0.022). Cross-sectional surface area of palpation pain had poor correlation with corresponding cross-sectional MRI oedema area (r=0.173, p=0.208). The symptoms subscale of the Copenhagen Hip And Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) for the period since injury (log odds ratio=0.97, p=0.021) and passive adductor stretch pain (log odds ratio=0.35, p=0.046) were associated with MRI injury grading. If there was a palpable defect, MRI always showed a complete avulsion (PPV=100%). Several tests had high negative predictive values: passive adductor stretch (100%), palpation pain at the adductor longus insertion (98%), and the FABER test (98%).The extent of palpation pain does not indicate the extent of MRI oedema in acute adductor longus injuries. A worse modified HAGOS symptoms subscale score and passive adductor stretch pain indicate a higher MRI adductor injury grade.

          "abstract": "All skeletal muscles produce their largest forces at a single optimal length, losing force when stretched or shortened. In vertebrate feeding systems, this fundamental force-length relationship translates to variation in bite force across gape, which affects the food types that can be eaten effectively. We measured the bite force-gape curves of two sympatric species: king salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchusgorbuscha). Cranial anatomical measurements were not significantly different between species; however, peak bite forces were produced at significantly different gapes. Maximum bite force was achieved at 67% of maximum gape for king salmon and 43% of maximum gape for pink salmon. This may allow king salmon to use greater force when eating large or elusive prey. In contrast, pink salmon do not require high forces at extreme gapes for filter feeding. Our results illustrate that the bite force-gape relationship is an important ecophysiological axis of variation.© 2020. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Tendon springs often influence locomotion by amplifying the speed and power of limb joint rotation. However, less is known about elastic recoil action in feeding systems, particularly for small aquatic animals. Here, we ask if elastic recoil amplifies the speed of gape closing during aquatic food processing in the Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). We measure activation of the adductor mandibulae externus via electromyography and strain of the jaw adductor muscle-tendon unit (MTU), and gape kinematics via fluoromicrometry. The muscle is pre-activated coincident with gape opening, which causes MTU stretch. Activation lasts significantly shorter for fish than cricket processing, and muscle shortening during MTU lengthening yields significantly greater elastic strain for cricket processing. The speed of MTU shortening, which dictates the speed of gape closing is 2.5-4.4 times greater than the speed of the initial shortening of the muscle fascicles for fish and cricket gape cycles, respectively. These data demonstrate a clear role for elastic recoil, which may be unexpected for a MTU in a feeding system of a small, aquatic animal. Amplification of jaw-closing speed resulting from elastic recoil likely confers ecological advantages in reducing prey escape risks during food processing in a dense and viscous fluid environment.",

However, the effective flexion angle in stretching for each adductor muscle remains unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hip flexion angle on muscle elongation of hip adductor muscles during stretching. Sixteen healthy men were recruited for this study. Shear elastic modulus, an index of muscle elongation, of the adductor longus (AL), and both the anterior and posterior adductor magnus (anterior AM) were measured using ultrasonic shear wave elastography at rest (supine position) and at 5 stretching positions (maximal hip abduction at 90°, 60°, 30°, 0°, and -15° hip flexion). For the AL, the shear elastic modulus at rest was significantly lower than that in all stretching positions. However, there was no significant difference among stretching positions. For the anterior AM, there was no significant difference between stretching positions and at rest. For the posterior AM, the shear elastic modulus in 90°, 60°, and 30° hip flexion were significantly higher than that at rest. The shear elastic modulus in 90° hip flexion was significantly higher than that in 60° and 30° hip flexion. Our results suggest that the AL is elongated to the same extent by maximal hip abduction regardless of hip flexion angle, the anterior AM is not elongated regardless of the hip flexion angle; the posterior AM is elongated at all angles except at 0° and -15° hip flexion and is most extended at 90° hip flexion.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated longitudinal (α) rotation of the mandible and mediolateral displacement at the symphysis (Ω1 ) and temporomandibular joint (Ω2 ) as the mouth opened (Δ). Results indicated three phases of jaw opening. In the first phase, as gape increased from zero to 8°, there was slight (<1°) α and Ω rotation. As gape increased between 20 and 30°, the mandibles rotated slightly laterally (Mean 3°), the posterior condyles were slightly medially displaced (Mean 4°), and the anterior ends at the symphysis were laterally displaced (Mean 3°). In the third phase of jaw opening, from 30° to full (≥90°) gape, these motions reversed: mandibles rotated medially (Mean 29°), condyles were laterally displaced (Mean 14°), and symphyseal ends were medially displaced (Mean 1°). Movements were observed during jaw manipulation and analyzed with CT-images that confirmed quantitative inclinometer/accelerometer data, including the unstable intermediate (Phase 2) position. Together these shifting movements maintain a constant distance for adductor muscles stretched between the skull's temporal fossa and mandible's coronoid process. Mandibular rotation enlarges the buccal cavity's volume as much as 36%, likely to improve prey capture in rorqual lunge feeding; it may strengthen and stabilize jaw opening or closure, perhaps via a simple locking or unlocking mechanism. Rotated lips may brace baleen racks during filtration. Mandibular movements may serve a proprioceptive mechanosensory function, perhaps via the symphyseal organ, to guide prey engulfment and water expulsion for filtration.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The fiber architecture of these muscles has been correlated to specific diets (e.g., prey size in felids) and modes of foraging (e.g., tree gouging in marmosets). Despite the well-elucidated functional implications of this architecture, little is known about its ontogeny. To characterize age-related myological changes, we studied the masticatory muscles in a large (n = 33) intraspecific sample of a small, Malagasy primate, Microcebus murinus including neonatal through geriatric individuals. We removed each of the mandibular adductors and recorded its mass as well as other linear measurements. We then chemically dissected each muscle to study its architecture-fascicle length and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) which relate to stretch (gape) and force capabilities, respectively. We observed PCSA and muscle mass to increase rapidly and plateau in adulthood through senescence. Fascicle lengths remained relatively constant once maximal length was reached, which occurred early in life, suggesting that subsequent changes in PCSA are driven by changes in muscle mass. Quadratic curvilinear models of each of the architectural variables of all adductors combined as well as individual muscles regressed against age were all significant.

          "abstract": "Balance control has been shown to play a fundamental role both in everyday life and many athletic activities. An important component of balance control is the somatosensory information gained from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. The changes in the muscle-tendon unit stiffness could alter the ability to detect and respond promptly to changes of an unstable environment. One of the procedures affecting muscle stiffness is stretching, and contract-relax PNF stretching (CRS) is considered as one of the safest and most effective techniques. So far, there are no studies on the impact of CRS of hip adductor and abductor muscles on body balance. These muscle groups are responsible for maintaining mediolateral balance which is of particular interest, since it is more affected by ageing and disease and since its deterioration has been associated with an increased risk of falling. In light of the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of contract-relax proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching of hip adductors and abductors on mediolateral dynamic balance.The study involved 45 healthy individuals (age 19-23 years) assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Balance testing was carried out before (Pre) and immediately after CRS in the intervention group or after 5-minute rest in the control group (Post). There were performed three repetitions of the CRS targeting the adductor and abductor muscles of the hip.Statistically significant differences between Pre and Post condition were observed only in the intervention group. The values of all measured variables defining the body's dynamic balance were significantly lower immediately after the applied CRS, which indicates an improved body balance: Global Index (p = 0.0001), total area of sway (p = 0.0001), external area of sway (p = 0.00004), external time (p = 0.0004) and reaction time (p = 0.0003).A single dose of contract-relax proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching of the hip adductor and abductor muscles improved mediolateral dynamic balance.",

Literature review revealed little research had specifically been done on the most effective ways to stretch the hip adductor muscles. The purpose was to determine the effects that an acute bout of SS (active vs passive) has on hip adductor flexibility and maintenance of strength. Randomized cross-over study using a 3 × 2 (Condition X Time) repeated measures ANOVA statistical design. Forty healthy and physically active subjects (20 male and 20 female) that screened positive for limited flexibility in hip adductor range of motion (ROM) participated. Following a warm-up, baseline maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) and peak static ROM tests were administered. On separate days subjects randomly performed either 60 seconds of passive SS, active SS, or a time-matched control protocol before post measures were recorded for MVC and ROM. There was a significant time effect (p<0.001) that revealed both types of SS and control resulted in increased ROM pre-to-post (passive = 1.0; active = 1.1; control = 0.6 degrees) with no between condition differences (p=0.171). Neither type of SS resulted in reduced strength. Both methods minimally increased hip adductor flexibility without a decrease in force output.

          "abstract": "Study Design A pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Background The effectiveness of physical therapy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is unknown. Objectives To determine the feasibility of an RCT investigating the effectiveness of a physical therapy intervention for FAIS. Methods Participants were 17 women and 7 men (mean ± SD age, 37 ± 8 years; body mass index, 25.4 ± 3.4 kg/m2) with FAIS who received physical therapy interventions provided over 12 weeks. The FAIS-specific physical therapy group received personalized progressive strengthening and functional retraining. The control group received standardized stretching exercises. In addition, both groups received manual therapy, progressive physical activity, and education. The primary outcome was feasibility, including integrity of the protocol, recruitment and retention, outcome measures, randomization procedure, and sample-size estimate. Secondary outcomes included hip pain and function (international Hip Outcome Tool-33 [iHOT-33]) and hip muscle strength. Poststudy interviews were conducted to determine potential improvements for future studies. Results Twenty-four (100%) patients with known eligibility agreed to participate. Four patients (17%) were lost to follow-up. All participants and the tester remained blinded, and the control intervention was acceptable to participants. The between-group mean differences in change scores were 16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -9, 38) for the iHOT-33 and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.47) Nm/kg for hip adduction strength, favoring the FAIS-specific physical therapy group. Using an effect size of 0.61, between-group improvements for the iHOT-33 suggest that 144 participants are required for a full-scale RCT. Conclusion A full-scale RCT of physical therapy for FAIS is feasible. A FAIS-specific physical therapy program has the potential for a moderate to large positive effect on hip pain, function, and hip adductor strength. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 2b.

          "abstract": "Reciprocal inhibition of motor neurons via Ia inhibitory interneurons recruited by stimulation of proprioceptive afferents supplying antagonist muscles has been well described. Changes in the efficacy of inhibition, and sometimes even a switch from inhibition to facilitation, have been reported in the literature after disruption of descending pathways. We sought to test whether such facilitation could be expressed in normal animals by evaluating the presence of facilitation in acute preparations from uninjured animals. Using an isolated spinal cord preparation from neonatal mice, changes in the monosynaptic stretch reflex response in knee flexor motor neurons (posterior biceps semitendinosus; PBST) were monitored following conditioning stimulation of proprioceptive sensory afferents in other muscle nerves. As expected for reciprocal inhibition, conditioning by stimulation of quadriceps (knee extensors and PBST antagonists) sensory afferents resulted in inhibition of the stretch reflex response. Facilitation, however, of the stretch reflex response by quadriceps conditioning stimulation was observed when the glycinergic reciprocal inhibitory pathway was blocked by application of strychnine. Facilitation was elicited by low-threshold proprioceptive afferents and occurred at latencies consistent with a disynaptic circuit. The magnitude of facilitation was larger at birth than at one week postnatal. Our results also suggest reciprocal facilitation is restricted to antagonist muscle pairs, as facilitation of PBST responses was not observed when conditioned with the obturator nerve supplying the adductor muscles. Overall, these data suggest the efficacy of facilitation is modulated during the first postnatal week, while the specificity of facilitation is already established by birth.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have sought to link craniofacial morphology with behavioral ecology in primates. Extant hard-object feeders have been of particular interest because of their potential to inform our understanding about the diets of early fossil hominins. Sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) are hard-object feeders that frequently generate what have been described as audibly powerful bites at wide jaw gapes to process materially stiff and hard seeds. We address the hypothesis that sooty mangabeys have features of the masticatory apparatus that facilitate this feeding behavior by comparing fiber architecture and leverage of the masseter and temporalis muscles between sooty mangabeys and three papionin primates that do not specialize on hard objects. Contrary to predictions, sooty mangabeys do not have relatively larger muscle physiologic cross-sectional areas or weights compared to other papionins, nor do they consistently display improved leverage. In this regard, sooty mangabeys differ in their morphology from other hard-object feeders such as tufted capuchins. However, males of all four papionin species converge on a shared pattern of relatively longer anterior superficial masseter fibers compared with female conspecifics, suggesting that males are likely prioritizing muscle stretch to improve gape performance as part of a behavioral repertoire that includes agonistic social interactions and intense male-male competition. These findings strengthen support for the hypothesis that gape display behaviors can exert a strong selective influence throughout the musculoskeletal masticatory apparatus. Results also raise questions about the morphological suitability of extant cercopithecines as models for interpreting feeding behavior and diet in fossil hominins with limited jaw gape capacity.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of individual hip muscles to the net hip power in normal adult self-selected speed walking. A further goal was to examine each muscle's role in propulsion or support of the body during that task.An EMG-to-force processing (EFP) model was developed which scaled muscle-tendon unit (MTU) force output to gait EMG. Active muscle power was defined as the product of MTU forces (derived from EFP) and that muscle's contraction velocity. Passive hip power was estimated from passive moments associates with hip position (angle of flexion (extension)) and the hip's angular velocity. Net hip EFP power was determined by summing individual active hip muscle power plus the net passive hip power at each percent gait cycle interval. Net hip power was also calculated for these study participants via inverse dynamics (kinetics plus kinematics, KIN). The inverse dynamics technique - well accepted in the biomechanics literature - was used as a \"gold standard\" for validation of this EFP model. Closeness of fit of the power curves of the two methods was used to validate the model.The correlation between the EFP and KIN methods was sufficiently close, suggesting validation of the model's ability to provide reasonable estimates of power produced by individual hip muscles. Key findings were that (1) most muscles undergo a stretch-shorten cycle of muscle contraction, (2) greatest power was produced by the hip abductors, and (3) the hip adductors contribute to either hip adduction or hip extension (but not both).The EMG-to-force processing approach provides reasonable estimates of individual hip muscle forces in self-selected speed walking in neurologically-intact adults.",

Little research has been done on the acute effects of a single session of stretching on hip abduction range of motion (ROM).The aim of this study was to compare 3 clinical stretching procedures against passive static stretching and control on ROM and peak isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC).Using a randomized crossover study design, a total of 40 participants (20 male and 20 female) who had reduced hip adductor muscle length attended a familiarization session and 5 testing sessions on non-consecutive days.Following the warm-up and pre-intervention measures of ROM and MVC, participants were randomly assigned 1 of 3 clinical stretching procedures (modified lunge, multidirectional, and joint mobilization) or a static stretch or control condition. Post-intervention measures of ROM and MVC were taken immediately following completion of the assigned condition.An ANOVA using a repeated measure design with the change score was conducted. All interventions resulted in small but statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases (1.0°-1.7°) in ROM with no inter-condition differences except one. Multidirectional stretching was greater than control (p = 0.031).These data suggest that a single session of stretching has only a minimal effect on acute changes of hip abduction ROM.

          "abstract": "Therapeutic exercises in osteoarthritis (OA) are therapeutic approach with proven efficacy. However, the different disease forms, the lack of established consensus and system for patient education limit the widespread use of therapeutic exercises in clinical practice. The mechanisms of action of therapeutic exercise in OA include the following components e.g. neuromuscular (improvement of proprioception, muscle strength and joint stability), intra-articular (prevention of cartilage degeneration, antiinflammatory effect, improvement of the quality of the joint fluid), periarticular, general health with reduction of cardiovascular risk and psychological components. The main exercises, which are used in OA patients, are stretching exercises, range of motion exercises, analytic exercises for muscle strengthening (isometric and isotonic) and aerobic exercises (walking, cycling, swimming, etc.). The recommended exercise programmes have to be individualized according to patient age, severity of OA and presence of concomitant diseases. The analytic exercises for improvement of muscle strength in hip OA aim to influence the abductors, adductors, flexors and extensors of the hip joint. In knee OA, the target muscle groups are thigh muscles (quadriceps muscle and posterior group of thigh muscles), calf muscles (triceps surae muscle) as well as muscles around the hip joint. There are no established programmes for therapeutic exercises regarding the intensity, frequency, the degree and the interval for increasing of joint load. No significant difference in the efficacy of group vs. individual exercise programmes has been observed. In OARSI recommendations (2010), it is underlined that aerobic exercises and those for muscle strength have a moderate efficacy in knee OA for pain relief e.g. ES (effect size) - 0.52 (for aerobic exercises) and 0.32 (for strengthening exercises). The ES for functional improvement is 0.46 for the aerobic exercises and 0.32 for the strengthening exercises. The data for the role of therapeutic exercises in hip OA are scarce. An effect on pain has been observed (ES-0.38) but without improvement of functional capacity. Therapeutic exercises have low to moderate complex efficacy in patients with OA. They should be an obligatory part in the therapeutic regimens of the patients, which requires close collaboration between rheumatologists, general practitioners and physiotherapists as well as establishment of system for patient education.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.",

The opening period of the piezo-electrically operated valve determines the droplet size. With a high-speed camera system, the change in the airspeed of the drop can be determined, depending on the set water reservoir pressure. With the knowledge of the droplet size, the shooting speed and the estimation of the distance between the valve and laryngeal mucosa or airspeed can be determined the muzzle energy. By mounting the MIT device to a high speed glottography system, the time between the impact of the droplet on the laryngeal mucosa and the start of the laryngeal adduction, the LAR latency can be determined using an image by image evaluation.In dysphagia with penetration or aspiration it is presumed that the protective function of the larynx is no longer adequately ensured. The MIT-LAR device provides a valid and reliable method to assess LAR quantitatively.

The mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not explained within the context of the cross-bridge theory and are rarely studied in concert. Previous studies have shown RFE to be speed-independent. In the present study, we investigated if RFE preceded by active shortening is time-dependent by electrically evoking RFE in the human adductor pollicis muscle. The results shown that a slow stretch following FD fully re-established RFE compared to higher speeds of stretch. The mechanism(s) responsible for the recovery of RFE following a preceding shortening contraction (FD) might be associated with the recovery of cross-bridge based force and/or the re-engagement of a passive structural element (titin).

          "abstract": "Platyrrhines span two orders of magnitude in body size and are characterized by diverse feeding behaviors and diets. While size plays an important role in primate feeding behavior and masticatory apparatus morphology, we know little about size-correlated changes in the force-generating (physiologic cross-sectional area; PCSA) and excursion/stretch (fiber length; Lf ) capabilities of the jaw-closing muscles in platyrrhines.We examined scaling relationships of the superficial masseter and temporalis muscles in 21 platyrrhine species. Previous work suggests that larger platyrrhines are at a mechanical disadvantage for generating bite forces compared with smaller platyrrhines. We hypothesize that scaling of jaw-muscle fiber architecture counters this size-correlated decrease in mechanical advantage. Thus, we predicted that jaw-muscle PCSAs and muscle weights scale with positive allometry while Lf s scale with negative allometry, relative to load-arm estimates for incisor/molar biting and chewing.Jaw-muscle PCSAs and Lf s appear to scale with negative allometry relative to load-arm estimates and body size. Negative allometry of jaw-muscle weights partially accounts for the size-correlated decreases in PCSA and Lf . Estimates of bite force also scale with negative allometry.Large-bodied platyrrhines (e.g., Alouatta) are at a relative disadvantage for generating jaw-muscle and bite force as well as jaw-muscle stretch, compared with smaller species (e.g., Callithrix). The net effect is that larger platyrrhines likely produce relatively smaller maximal bite forces compared with smaller taxa. Relative to small- and intermediate-sized platyrrhines, large-bodied platyrrhines feed on some of the least mechanically challenging foods, consistent with the size-correlated decrease in relative muscle and bite forces across the clade.

This study aims to evaluate the reliability of various performance- and spasticity-related parameters collected with a manually controlled instrumented spasticity assessment in four lower limb muscles in children with cerebral palsy (CP).The lateral gastrocnemius, medial hamstrings, rectus femoris and hip adductors of 12 children with spastic CP (12.8 years, ±4.13 years, bilateral/unilateral involvement n=7/5) were passively stretched in the sagittal plane at incremental velocities. Muscle activity, joint motion, and torque were synchronously recorded using electromyography, inertial sensors, and a force/torque load-cell. Reliability was assessed on three levels: (1) intra- and (2) inter-rater within session, and (3) intra-rater between session.Parameters were found to be reliable in all three analyses, with 90% containing intra-class correlation coefficients >0.6, and 70% of standard error of measurement values <20% of the mean values. The most reliable analysis was intra-rater within session, followed by intra-rater between session, and then inter-rater within session. The Adds evaluation had a slightly lower level of reliability than that of the other muscles.Limited intrinsic/extrinsic errors were introduced by repeated stretch repetitions. The parameters were more reliable when the same rater, rather than different raters performed the evaluation. Standardisation and training should be further improved to reduce extrinsic error when different raters perform the measurement. Errors were also muscle specific, or related to the measurement set-up. They need to be accounted for, in particular when assessing pre-post interventions or longitudinal follow-up.

However, mechanisms of this performance enhancement remain a matter of debate. One proposed mechanism is associated with a stretch-induced increase in steady-state force, referred to as residual force enhancement (RFE). As yet, direct evidence relating RFE to increased force/work during SSCs is missing. Therefore, forces of electrically stimulated m. adductor pollicis (n = 14 subjects) were measured during and after pure stretch, pure shortening, and stretch-shortening contractions with varying shortening amplitudes. Active stretch (30°, ω = 161 ± 6°s(-1)) caused significant RFE (16%, P < 0.01), whereas active shortening (10°, 20°, and 30°; ω = 103 ± 3°s(-1), 152 ± 5°s(-1), and 170 ± 5°s(-1)) resulted in significant force depression (9-15%, P < 0.01). In contrast, after SSCs (that is when active stretch preceded active shortening) no force depression was found. Indeed for our specific case in which the shortening amplitude was only 1/3 of the lengthening amplitude, there was a remnant RFE (10%, P < 0.01) following the active shortening. This result indicates that the RFE generated during lengthening affected force depression when active lengthening was followed by active shortening. As conventional explanations, such as the storage and release of elastic energy, cannot explain the enhanced steady-state force after SSCs, it appears that the stretch-induced RFE is not immediately abolished during shortening and contributes to the increased force and work during SSCs.© 2015 The Authors.

          "abstract": "Water flow inside the shell of Mytilus galloprovincialis was measured by phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In seawater without algal cells at 23 °C, water approached the mussel from the posterior-ventral side, and entered through the inhalant aperture at a velocity of 40-20 mm s(-1). The flow rate in the lower mantle cavity decreased to 10-20 mm s(-1), the water flowed in the anterior-dorsal direction and approached the demibranches at a velocity of 5-10 mm s(-1). After passing through the lamellae to the upper mantle cavity, the water stretched the interlamellar cavity, turned to the posterior-dorsal direction and accumulated in the epibranchial cavity. The water flows came together at the ventral side of the posterior adductor muscle. The velocity increased more to than 50 mm s(-1) in the exhalant siphon, and exhaled out in the posterior-dorsal direction. The anterior-posterior direction of the flow was imaged every 1.92 s by the inflow effect of T1-weighted MRI. The flow seemed to be constant, and no cyclic motion of the mantles or the gills was detected. Spontaneous closure of the shells caused a quick drop of the flow in the mantle cavity. In the opening process of the shells, water flow in the interlamellar cavities increased before the opening, followed by an increase of flows in the exhalant siphon and inhalant aperture with minimum delay, reaching a plateau within 1 min of the shells opening. This provides direct evidence that the lateral cilia drive water in the mussel M. galloprovincialis.© 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",

Performance in speed (10 and 20 m) and agility (T-test) was measured after the control and experimental conditions. Static stretching, consisting of stretches for hip extensors, hip adductors, knee extensors, knee flexors, and ankle sole flexors, was performed after light cardiovascular exercise (8 minutes). A 1-way repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that speed was improved only by SS of short duration (15/20 seconds), whereas agility remained unaffected by all SS trials. When participants' speed and agility level was taken into account, it was revealed that only those of moderate performance demonstrated an improved speed (in 15- and 20-second trials) and agility (in 10- and 15-second trials) performance. These results suggest that short-duration SS protocols induce an acute improvement of speed and agility performance, whereas longer-duration SS protocols have neither positive nor negative effect. Furthermore, it seems that individuals of lower speed and agility performance level are more likely to benefit by a short-duration SS protocol.",

Adductor dysfunction is the most common cause of groin pain in athletes, with the adductor longus being the tendon most commonly involved. The most reproducible finding for adductor longus tendinopathy is tenderness along the tendon with passive abduction and resisted hip adduction in extension. Magnetic resonance imaging and injection of a corticosteroid and anesthetic into the proximal muscle-tendon junction are both helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Nonoperative treatment may consist of protected weight bearing, ice application, ultrasonography, electrical stimulation, and gentle stretching with progressive strengthening. However, nonoperative management is not always successful. In these instances, surgical treatment can be quite effective. We present the indications, surgical technique, and rehabilitation protocol of adductor tenotomy for chronic tendinopathy.

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate deep tendon reflex responses and associated electrophysiological parameters of the muscles in patients with fibromyalgia. This cross-sectional study included 38 patients with fibromyalgia and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Deep tendon reflexes of the rectus femoris and triceps brachii were tested using a reflex hammer. Electromyographic (amplitude and duration of activation), inertial measurement unit (angular velocity, acceleration), and electromechanical (delay) analyses were performed using a surface electromyography (sEMG) device. Comparative analyses were carried out between patients and controls. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of hyperreflexia in distinguishing fibromyalgia patients from controls. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the right/left rectus femoris and/or triceps brachii were observed in more than 85% (ranging from 86.8 to 94.7%) of the fibromyalgia group. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly increased deep tendon reflex responses compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients revealed significantly higher amplitude, longer duration of muscle activation, greater sagittal acceleration and angular velocity, and shorter electromechanical delay. Normalized muscle activation (right and left rectus femoris and right triceps brachii) in response to deep tendon reflex test showed acceptable ability in differentiating fibromyalgia patients from controls (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.890, 0.784 and 0.782, respectively). For the right rectus femoris, values ≤ 28.3 (clinically corresponding to normoactive/hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) appeared to rule-out fibromyalgia with 94.1% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibit increased deep tendon reflex responses. Normal or decreased deep tendon reflex responses may probably be used as a rule-out criterion for fibromyalgia.© 2025.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week FW training program on jump performance, stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function, muscle strength, peak power and muscle thickness in collegiate basketball players. Twenty male college basketball players (mean age: 19.8 ± 1.3 years, height: 179.1 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 72.9 ± 6.3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the FW training (n = 11) or control group (n = 9). The FW training group performed squat exercises, 5 sets of 8 repetitions, twice a week using the FW device. Baseline and post-training assessments of jump heights of squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and drop jumps (DJs) were performed in both groups. Additionally, the reactive strength index (RSI), representing SSC function; isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque during knee joint extension; peak power during squats; and quadriceps muscle thickness were evaluated. As the results, we observed that the FW training group demonstrated significant increases in post-training SJ height (15.1%, p = 0.03), DJ height (23.2%, p = 0.01), RSI (36.8%, p = 0.04), MVC, peak power and muscle thickness compared with pre-training levels. Furthermore, between-group comparisons indicated significantly higher post-training SJ height, DJ height, RSI, MVC, peak power, and muscle thickness in the FW training group (p < 0.05). Therefore, the FW training program effectively enhanced jump performance and SSC function in male basketball players and proved beneficial for muscle strength and hypertrophy.© 2025 The Author(s).

The participants adjusted their stretching inrectus femoris muscle tensity to a point immediately before experiencing discomfort or pain. The Young's modulus of the rectus femoris muscle and the knee-flexion range of motion were measured as indicators of flexibility. The Young's modulus was measured using shear wave elastography. Measurements were performed at baseline, as well as at two and four weeks after the stretching program started. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess the change in the Young's modulus after the stretching program and the effects of the Young's modulus on the knee-flexion range of motion.The Young's modulus of the rectus femoris muscle decreased after two and four weeks of stretching compared with the baseline (p = 0.0004 and p <0.0001, respectively). The Young's modulus of the rectus femoris muscle and the four-week duration of stretching affected the knee-flexion range of motion (p = 0.0242 and 0.0016, respectively).Shear wave elastography quantitatively revealed that several weeks of static stretching increased the flexibility of the rectus femoris muscle in healthy men.

Therefore, this study tries to determine the structures affected during the stretching of the front thigh.An observational study of the front thigh was conducted. The directions and intensities of the reaction forces were recorded. The patellar travel was used to determine the average coordinates of the stretched structures at hip level in the horizontal plane. The participants indicated the stretched area. The stretch of a patient with a complete tear of his left rectus femoris was recorded.The reaction force of the thigh was oriented at 33° (standard deviation [SD]: 6°) sideways and its intensity was 60 N m (SD: 19 N m). The centroid coordinates of all stretched structures were stable. The registered average external rotational torque of 6 N m (SD: 3.7 N m) could only be mediated by the FL. The stretched area indicated by the participants could be anywhere on the FL. The tolerated reaction force increased in the same way on the disinserted rectus femoris thigh and on the uninjured thigh.Ober's, Modified Thomas', and Ely's tests are three potential means of assessing FL extensibility.

          "abstract": "Professional soccer players frequently experience fatigue due to the demanding nature of the sport. In this context, effective recovery strategies are essential for maintaining performance. Static stretching (SS) is commonly used in soccer, but its efficacy is debated. Vibration foam rolling (VFR) is a novel recovery technique that has not been extensively studied in soccer.This research aimed to investigate the acute effects of VFR (3 sets of 45 s of rolling and 15 s of rest between sets) and SS (3 sets of 45 s and 15 s of rest between sets) on muscle contractile properties in professional soccer players.Eighteen players participated in this counterbalanced crossover study. Settings: After a 1-week washout period between sessions, the subjects completed the 2 condition trials (VFR or SS) in counterbalanced order following a training session, which had a duration of 77 min and a total distance of 6500 m covered.Muscle contractile properties of the rectus femoris were assessed with tensiomyography before training (pre), immediately after training (post 1), and postrecovery intervention (post 2). Tensiomyography parameters included maximal radial muscle-belly displacement and contraction time and velocity. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance.There were no significant differences in the training load between groups during the training sessions (P > .05). Results showed that maximal radial muscle-belly displacement (P = .004) and contractiontime (P = .007) significantly decrease from pre (before training) to post 1 (after training). No significant main effects for group were obtained for all the variables (P > .05). However, both VFR and SS interventions effectively restored maximal radialmuscle-belly displacement (P = .011) and contraction time (P = .008) from post 1 (after) to post 2 (postrecovery intervention), suggesting reduced muscular stiffness. Contraction velocity remained unchanged after both interventions (P > .05).Therefore, these interventions could offer valuable advantages for posttraining neuromuscular acute recovery in professional soccer players.",

          "abstract": "Whereas prolonged static stretching (SS: >60-seconds per muscle) can increase range of motion (ROM) for up to 2-hours, it can also decrease maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) forces, countermovement (CMJ) and drop jump (DJ) heights, and muscle activation immediately after the stretching exercise. When an appropriate SS duration (<60-seconds per muscle) is incorporated into a dynamic warm-up, performance decrements are often trivial. However, there is a lack of studies that observed the effects of extensive SS (180-seconds) 2-hours prior to a dynamic warm-up. The objective was to investigate ROM and performance effects of prolonged SS, 2-hours prior to a traditional warm-up. This study investigated 9 female and 8 male healthy recreationally active, young adult participants on the effects of prolonged SS (180-seconds per muscle) of the quadriceps and hamstrings, 2-hours before a traditional warm-up compared to an active control condition on hip flexion ROM, knee extension and flexion MVIC forces, CMJ, DJ, and quadriceps and hamstrings electromyography (EMG). There were no significant changes in knee flexion/extension MVIC forces, EMG, CMJ, or DJ height. However, there was significant, small magnitude (p = 0.002) greater post-warm-up left hip flexion ROM (115.4° ± 17.2) than pre-SS (108.9° ± 17.13, Effect size [ES]: 0.28) and control post-warm-up (p = 0.05, ES: 0.31, 109.5° ± 20.55). Similarly, right hip flexion ROM (117.2° ± 16.5) also demonstrated significant small magnitude (p = 0.003) greater than the pre-SS (112.4° ± 18.4, ES: 0.22) and control post-warm-up (p = 0.046, ES: 0.33, 110.8° ± 20.5). Additionally, significant, large magnitude greater hip flexion ROM was observed with the women vs. men (ES: 1.29 - 1.34).

          "abstract": "Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) represents a promising technique for promoting functional recovery in individuals with neuromuscular diseases. Traditionally, current pulses are delivered through self-adhesive hydrogel Ag/AgCl electrodes, which allow a good contact with the skin, are easy-to-use and have a moderate cost. However, skin adherence decreases after a few uses and skin irritations can originate. Recently, textile electrodes have become an attractive alternative as they assure increased durability, easy integration into clothes and can be conveniently cleaned, improving the wearability of FES. However, as various manufacture processes were attempted, their clear validation is lacking. This proof-of-concept study proposes a novel set of ink-based printed textile electrodes and compares them to adhesive hydrogel electrodes in terms of impedance, stimulation performance and perceived comfort.The skin-electrode impedance was evaluated for both types of electrodes under different conditions. These electrodes were then used to deliver FES to the Rectus Femoris of 14 healthy subjects to induce its contraction in both isometric and dynamic conditions. This allowed to compare the two types of electrodes in terms of sensory, motor, maximum and pain thresholds, FES-induced range of motion during dynamic tests, FES-induced torque during isometric tests and perceived stimulation comfort.No statistically significant differences were found both in terms of stimulation performance (Wilcoxon test) and comfort (Generalized Linear Mixed Model).The results showed that the proposed ink-based printed textile electrodes can be effectively used as alternative to hydrogel ones. Further experiments are needed to evaluate their durability and their response to sterilizability and stretching tests.© 2024 International Center for Artificial Organ and Transplantation (ICAOT) and Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM. Additional contributors to ROM might be tendon stiffness or stretch/pain tolerance.Copyright © Biology of Sport 2024.",

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities.

Determining changes in muscle size and architecture after exercise training: One site does not fit all. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 787-790, 2024-Different methods can be used to assess muscle hypertrophy, but the effects of training on regional changes in muscle size can be detected only using direct muscle measurements such as muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, or volume. Importantly, muscle size increases vary across regions within and between muscles after resistance training programs (i.e., heterogeneous, or nonuniform, muscle hypertrophy). Muscle architectural changes, including fascicle length and pennation angle, after resistance and stretch training programs are also region-specific. In this paper, we show that the literature indicates that a single-site measure of muscle shape does not properly capture the effects achieved after exercise training interventions and that conclusions concerning the magnitude of muscle adaptations can vary substantially depending on the muscle site to be examined. Thus, we propose that measurements of muscle size and architecture should be completed at multiple sites across regions between the agonist muscles within a muscle group and along the length of the muscles to provide an adequate picture of training effects.Copyright © 2023 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

Many techniques have been described in the literature to restore knee flexion, with the most common one being an arthroscopic lysis of adhesions. However, in severe cases, additional intra- and extra-articular procedures are needed to restore full knee flexion. Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) is one of them. Unfortunately, it may lead to devastating complications, such as iatrogenic rupture of the patellar tendon or fractures of the patella or tibial tuberosity. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to present a safer modification of MUA for knee extension contracture in cases in which excessive force is demanded to achieve flexion.

          "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the impact of isolated static stretching (4 sets of 30 seconds) and its combined form with 10 repetitive drop jumps on lower limb performance during squat jumps at different knee joint starting angles (60°, 90°, and 120°). Thirteen participants completed three randomly ordered experimental visits, each including a standardized warm-up and squat jumps at three angles, apart from the intervention or control. Information was gathered through a three-dimensional movement tracking system, electromyography system, and force platform. The electromyography data underwent wavelet analysis to compute the energy values across the four wavelet frequency bands. The average power (Pavg), peak power (Ppeak), peak ground reaction force (GRFpeak), peak center of mass velocity (Vpeak), and force-velocity relationship at peak power (SFv) were extracted from the force and velocity-time data. The results revealed no significant influence of isolated static stretching, or its combined form with drop jumps, on the energy values across the frequency bands of the gastrocnemius, biceps femoris and rectus femoris, or the Pavg or Ppeak (P > 0.05). However, at 120°, static stretching reduced the GRFpeak (P = 0.001, d = 0.86) and SFv (P < 0.001, d = 1.12), and increased the Vpeak (P = 0.001, d = 0.5). The GRFpeak, Pavg, Ppeak, and SFv increased with an increase in the joint angle (P < 0.05), whereas the Vpeak decreased (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that static stretching does not diminish power output during squat jumps at the three angles; however, it alters GRFpeak, Vpeak, and the relative contributions of force and velocity to peak power at 120°, which can be eliminated by post-activation performance enhancement. Moreover, compared to 60° and 90°, 120° was more favorable for power and peak force output.© Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",

While stretching and massage techniques have been reported to be effective in alleviating APT, it remains unclear if similar improvements can be elicited by posterior chain and core strength training. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an 8-week posterior and core strengthening program on APT, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio, and vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.Ten healthy males (age = 26±12 years; mass = 87±14 kg; height = 1.8±0.1 m) and nine healthy females (age = 22±4 years; mass = 70±14 kg; heigh t = 1.7±0.1 m) performed resistance training (2×/week; 40-45 mins) involving a combination of hip extensors and abdominal strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals. Our findings have potential implications for clinicians prescribing resistance training exercises to improve pelvic posture in healthy asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing chronic low back pain and lumbar-spinal pathologies due to excessive anterior pelvic tilt.",

          "abstract": "Affective responses during exercise have been identified as a predictor of exercise adherence. However, research has been mostly limited to aerobic and resistance exercise. Considering that stretching activities are also an important component of physical fitness, this quasi-experimental study was designed to: 1) compare affective responses during and immediately after stretching exercises in apparently healthy adults, and 2) assess the consistency and repeatability of affect ratings obtained one week apart. For this purpose, we analyzed the Feeling Scale (FS) and Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) ratings using Time (during and after stretching) x Intensity (light, moderate, vigorous) x Stretched Muscle Group (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, latissimus dorsi, triceps) with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANCOVA) in 34 participants (21 males; aged 32.8 ± 8.6 years). The repeatability of FS and FAS ratings was assessed using two-way random-effects models, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. FS scores were higher following the stretching exercises, whereas FAS scores were lower, particularly in the vigorous intensity. In general, the inter-day repeatability for FS and FAS measurements was good across muscle groups. ICC tended to be higher at vigorous intensities. Ratings of core affect can be collected during static passive stretches using the FAS and FAS in ecologically valid settings. These results suggest that an adequate assessment of core affective responses to stretching activities should be performed during the exercises.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Tai Chi has been proved effective and highly recommended for KOA management worldwide. However, little is known about its benefits on quadriceps strength which is closely associated with relieving knee pain. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tai Chi on knee pain and muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults with KOA.A total of 100 participants will be randomly divided into a Tai Chi group (TC group) (1x/week for 12 weeks) and a control group with a health education and stretching program (1x/week for 12 weeks) with a follow-up period of 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscale at week 12 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include WOMAC stiffness and function subscales, data from isokinetic dynamometry, gait analysis with electromyography (EMG), and a 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). The daily dose of pain-relieving medication will also be recorded. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).We expect this randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi on relieving pain and increasing quadriceps strength in KOA patients. This protocol, if proven effective, will contribute to providing a promising alternative intervention for middle-aged and older adults with KOA.This trial has been registered in the China Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2300069339).© 2023.

Our previous research has shown that hyperreflexia of the rectus femoris (RF) during pre-swing is closely associated with reduced swing phase knee flexion in those with post-stroke Stiff-Knee gait (SKG). Thus, reduction of RF hyperreflexia may improve walking function in those with post-stroke SKG. A non-pharmacological procedure for reducing hyperreflexia has emerged based on operant conditioning of H-reflex, an electrical analog of the spinal stretch reflex. It is currently unknown whether operant conditioning can be applied to the RF. This feasibility study trained 7 participants (5 neurologically intact, 2 post-stroke) to down-condition the RF H-reflex using visual feedback. We found an overall decrease in average RF H-reflex amplitude among all 7 participants (44% drop, p < 0.001, paired t-test), of which the post-stroke individuals contributed (49% drop). We observed a generalized training effect across quadriceps muscles. Post-stroke individuals exhibited improvements in peak knee-flexion velocity, reflex excitability during walking, and clinical measures of spasticity. These outcomes provide promising initial results that operant RF H-reflex conditioning is feasible, encouraging expansion to post-stroke individuals. This procedure could provide a targeted alternative in spasticity management.© 2023. The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "Static stretch training (SST) with long stretching durations seems to be sufficient to increase flexibility, maximum strength (MSt) and muscle thickness (MTh). However, changes in contraction properties and effects on muscle damage remain unclear. Consequently, the objective of the study was to investigate the effects of a 6-week self-performed SST on MSt, MTh, contractile properties, flexibility, and acute response of creatine kinase (CK) 3 days after SST.Forty-four participants were divided into a control (CG, n = 22) and an intervention group (IG, n = 22), who performed a daily SST for 5 min for the lower limb muscle group. While isometric MSt was measured in leg press, MTh was examined via sonography and flexibility by functional tests. Muscle stiffness and contraction time were measured by tensiomyography on the rectus femoris. Additionally, capillary blood samples were taken in the pretest and in the first 3 days after starting SST to measure CK.A significant increase was found for MSt (p 0.310). Scheffé post hoc test did not show significant differences between the rectus femoris muscle inter- and intragroup comparisons for MTh nor for muscle stiffness and contraction time (p > 0.05, η 2 0.05, η 2 = 0.032.In conclusion, the increase in MSt cannot be exclusively explained by muscular hypertrophy or the increased CK-related repair mechanism after acute stretching. Rather, neuronal adaptations have to be considered. Furthermore, daily 5-min SST over 6 weeks does not seem sufficient to change muscle stiffness or contraction time. Increases in flexibility tests could be attributed to a stretch-induced change in the muscle-tendon complex.© 2023 Wohlann, Warneke, Hillebrecht, Petersmann, Ferrauti and Schiemann.",

          "abstract": "Wearable assistive technology for the lower extremities has shown great promise towards improving gait function in people with neuromuscular injuries. But common secondary impairments, such as hypersensitive stretch reflexes or hyperreflexia, have been often neglected. Incorporation of biomechanics into the control loop could improve individualization and avoid hyperreflexia. However, adding hyperreflexia prediction to the control loop would require expensive or complex measurement of muscle fiber characteristics. In this study, we explore a clinically accessible biomechanical predictor set that can accurately predict rectus femoris (RF) reaction after knee flexion assistance in pre-swing by a powered orthosis. We examined a total of 14 gait parameters based on gait kinematic, kinetic, and simulated muscle-tendon states from 8 post-stroke individuals with Stiff-Knee gait (SKG) wearing a knee exoskeleton robot. We independently performed both parametric and non-parametric variable selection approaches using machine learning regression techniques. Both models revealed the same four kinematic variables relevant to knee and hip joint motions were sufficient to effectively predict RF hyperreflexia. These results suggest that control of knee and hip kinematics may be a more practical method of incorporating quadriceps hyperreflexia into the exoskeleton control loop than the more complex acquisition of muscle fiber properties.© 2023.

          "abstract": "This retrospective (case-control) collaborative study evaluates tendon reflex recordings combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials recordings (T-MEPs) at lower limbs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).T-MEPs were recorded in 97 ALS patients distinguished according to their patellar reflex briskness. Patients' electrophysiological data were compared with values measured in 60 control patients matched for age and height. Correlations studies between parameters or with some patients' clinical characteristics were also performed.The central motor conduction time yields the highest sensitivity (82%) and specificity (93%), allowing twice more upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction detection than clinical examination, and being more altered in late stages of the disease. The T response to MEP response amplitude ratio (T/MEP ar) is nearly as sensitive to detect ALS and better identifies abnormal hyperreflexia. It is not correlated with evolutive stage, contrarily to conduction time-related parameters. In addition, T-MEPs detect asymmetries escaping clinical examination.The corticospinal conduction to lower limbs is slowed in ALS. The T/MEP ar helps deciding when patellar reflexes are abnormal in a given patient suspected of ALS.The T-MEP technique provide powerful electrophysiological biomarkers of UMN involvement in ALS. This simple and painless procedure introduces the clinically useful concept of electrophysiological hyperreflexia and might be expanded to future exploration of proximal upper limbs and bulbar territories.Copyright © 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The G values of some limb muscles were measured in relaxed and stretched positions.Regarding the effect of age on G at the distinct positions, the G of the upper limb muscles were not significantly correlated with age in the relaxed and stretched positions.

Additionally, the G of the rectus femoris had a significant negative correlation only in the relaxed position. Regarding differences among body parts, the G of the lower limb and oblique abdominal muscles showed a significant negative correlation, but no correlation in the upper limb, rectus abdominis, and back muscles. Moreover, MT showed a significant negative correlation with age in the lower limb, abdominal, and erector spinae muscles, but no correlation was detected in the upper limb and lumbar multifidus muscles. EI had a significant positive correlation in all the muscles.The effect of age on G depended on body parts, and the G of the lower limb and oblique abdominal muscles negatively associated with age.

Our aim was to ascertain whether the corrected position of the patella and improvement of the power of the quadriceps were maintained for 4 years or more. Twenty older children (mean age: 14.2 years) with long-standing crouch gait secondary to cerebral diplegia underwent surgery to correct crouch gait that included the patellar tendon shortening. The technique for plicating the tendon differed for skeletally mature and immature patients. The length of the patellar tendon was measured by the Koshino Index. The strength of the quadriceps muscle was assessed by manual muscle testing and with a dynamometer and extensor lag, if present, was measured with a goniometer. In all 40 knees, the patella was brought to a more distal position and the position was maintained for a mean duration of 84 months (Koshino Index: preoperative 1.3 ± 0.10; 3-month postoperative 0.95 ± 0.05; final follow-up 0.95 ± 0.04). The results were the same for the techniques used for skeletally mature and immature patients. The power of the quadriceps improved [Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 3 to MRC grade 4] and the improvement was maintained.

CASEs underwent corrective surgery for both the foot and knee deviations, inclusive of a QF aponeurectomy. Controls (CTRLs) underwent corrective surgery for foot deviations only. QF spasticity was assessed with the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) before and 1 month after surgery. The Wilcoxon test was used to assess MTS variations over time and the Mann-Whitney test was used to verify the presence of group differences at the 1 month mark.Ninety-three patients were included: 57 cases (30F, 1-34 years from lesion) and 36 controls (12F, 1-35 years from lesion). Before surgery, both CASEs and CTRLs had similar MTS scores (median MTS = 3) and functional characteristics. One month after surgery, QF spasticity was significantly lower in the CASEs compared to CTRLs (p = 0.033) due to a significant reduction of the median MTS score from 3 to 0 in the CASE group (p < 0.001) and no variations in the CTRL group (p = 0.468). About half of the cases attained clinically significant MTS reductions and complete symptom relief even many years from the stroke.Functional surgery inclusive of QF aponeurectomy can be effective in reducing or suppressing spasticity in chronic stroke patients. This is possibly a result of the reduction in neuromuscular spindle activation due to a decrease in muscle shortening, passive tension, and stiffness.Copyright © 2022 Merlo, Galletti, Zerbinati, Prati, Mascioli, Basini, Rambelli, Masiero and Mazzoli.",

Patients aged >65 years underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment. Anthropometric measurements, assessment of physical performance, muscle strength (handgrip strength [HGS]), muscle mass (B-mode muscle ultrasonography), and muscle quality (identified via SWE) were performed for all patients.The median (interquartile range) age of participants was 69 (59-76) years and 62% (n = 80) were female. According to HGS, patients were divided into normal and low HGS groups, and there were 85 (65.9%) and 44 (34.1%) patients in each group, respectively. The median average value of SWE measurement (Vmean ) of the rectus femoris (RF) in passive stretching was significantly lower in the low HGS group. In regression analyses, Vmean was significantly associated with HGS independently of age, sex, and body mass index. Optimal cutoff values of the Vmean value (m/s) of RF in passive stretching for predicting low HGS were ≤2.62 for male (area under the curve [AUC], 0.882; 95% CI, 0.705-0.938; P = <0.0001), and ≤2.52 for female (AUC, 0.719; 95% CI, 0.605-0.833; P = 0.002).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study revealing SWE is a good predictor of muscle strength, and it could be a useful tool for evaluating muscle quality in clinical practice.

The intervention program consisted of 9 physical function tests as well as 1 or 2 self-selected preventive exercises, including dynamic thoracic mobility, trunk stabilization exercises, and static stretching, performed during warm-up. Both groups were followed up for 4 weeks, during which the incidence of LBP was recorded. Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99).

Static stretching (SS) has been used to increase the flexibility of muscles and reduce muscle stiffness, but the effects of SS on the stiffness of specific regions of the knee extensor mechanism are unclear. The quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon are essential components of the knee extensor mechanism and play an important role in knee motion. Therefore, we explored the acute and prolonged effects of SS on the stiffness of the quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon and knee flexion range of motion (ROM). Thirty healthy male subjects participated in the study. Three 60-s SS with 30-s intervals were conducted in right knee flexion with 30° hip extension. We measured the ROM and stiffness of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF) and the proximal-(PPT), middle-(MPT), and distal-(DPT) region stiffness of the patellar tendon before and immediately after SS intervention, or 5 and 10 min after SS. The stiffness of the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon were measured using MyotonPRO, and the knee flexion ROM was evaluated using a medical goniometer. Our outcomes showed that the ROM was increased after SS intervention in all-time conditions (p < 0.01). Additionally, the results showed that the stiffness of RF (p < 0.01) and PPT (p = 0.03) were decreased immediately after SS intervention. These results suggested that SS intervention could be useful to increase knee flexion ROM and temporarily reduce the stiffness of specific regions of the knee extensor mechanism.Copyright © 2022 Zhu, Feng, Huang, Li, Wang, Wang, Cao and Zhang.",

Muscle activity, knee joint angles, and muscle fascicle length changes from the left-sided vastus lateralis (VL) muscle were quantified using surface electromyography, inertial measurement units, and B-mode ultrasound imaging, respectively. All rowing conditions showed active fascicle stretch during late knee flexion (p≤0.001, standardised mean difference (SMD) ≥0.72) and subsequent active fascicle shortening throughout knee extension. Active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.49) were not significantly different (p≥0.174; SMD≤0.26) between LiR and MpR, but were significantly increased during HiR (p≤0.001; SMD≥0.70). The percentage of rowing cycles that involved active fascicle stretch (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.95; post-hoc: p≤0.001, SMD≥0.87) was also significantly higher for HiR (98.3 ±12.9%) compared with both LiR (65.0 ± 48.1%) and MpR (68.3 ± 46.9%). In conclusion, rowing involves SSC at the VL muscle fascicle level, but the amount of active stretch differs between rowing intensities, with the longest, largest, and fastest active stretch occurring during HiR. SSC-based mechanisms may therefore contribute more to rowing performance during HiR than LiR or MpR.HighlightsSurface electromyography and ultrasound imaging revealed stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) of the vastus lateralis muscle fascicles during rowingIncreased active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity from low- to high-intensity rowing indicate that SSC-based mechanisms likely contribute more to performance during high-intensity rowingThe SSC within the vastus lateralis muscle was independent of the rowing style at the same low rowing intensity.",

          "abstract": "To investigate the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) combined with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on postural stability, muscle strength and pain in patients with tibial plateau fracture.A 3-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 60 patients with tibial plateau fracture. Participants received one of the following interventions: standard treatment (ST group, n = 20), ST + PNF training (ST + PNF group, n = 20), ST + PNF training + TEAS intervention (ST + PNF + TEAS group, n = 20). All treatments lasted for six weeks. Participants' postural stability, muscle strength and pain were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.After 3 weeks of intervention, Between-group comparisons showed that both the ST + PNF group and ST + PNF + TEAS group showed significantly greater performance than the ST group in the postural stability measure (P < 0.02) and pain score(P < 0.05). The peak torque of quadriceps extensors and flexors at the velocity of 60°/s was significantly higher in the ST + PNF + TEAS group than in the ST group (P < 0.02). After 6 weeks of intervention, only the ST + PNF + TEAS group was superior to the ST group in postural stability measure(P < 0.04) and in pain score (P < 0.05). The ST + PNF + TEAS group was significantly higher than the ST + PNF group and the ST group in the peak torque of quadriceps extensors at the velocity of 60°/s and 180°/s (P < 0.01).PNF training could improve dynamic postural stability and relieve pain at three weeks, while TEAS combined with PNF was more effective in relieving pain, strengthening muscle strength and improving dynamic postural stability at six weeks post-intervention.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "In hypertonic muscles of patients with upper motor neuron syndrome (UMNS), investigation with surface electromyography (EMG) with the muscle in a shortened position and during passive muscle stretch allows to identify two patterns underlying hypertonia: spasticity and spastic dystonia. We recently observed in Para swimmers that the effect of fatigue on hypertonia can be different from subject to subject. Our goal was, therefore, to understand whether this divergent behavior may depend on the specific EMG pattern underlying hypertonia. We investigated eight UMNS Para swimmers (five men, mean age 23.25 ± 3.28 years), affected by cerebral palsy, who presented muscle hypertonia of knee flexors and extensors. Muscle tone was rated using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). EMG patterns were investigated in rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) before and after two fatiguing motor tasks of increasing intensity. Before the fatiguing tasks, two subjects (#2 and 7) had spasticity and one subject (#5) had spastic dystonia in both RF and BF. Two subjects (#3 and 4) showed spasticity in RF and spastic dystonia in BF, whereas one subject (#1) had spasticity in RF and no EMG activity in BF. The remaining two subjects (#6 and 8) had spastic dystonia in RF and no EMG activity in BF. In all the 16 examined muscles, these EMG patterns persisted after the fatiguing tasks. Spastic dystonia increased (p 0.05). MAS scores increased only in the muscles affected by spastic dystonia. Among the phenomena possibly underlying hypertonia, only spastic dystonia is fatigue-dependent. Technical staff and medical classifiers should be aware of this specificity, because, in athletes with spastic dystonia, intense and prolonged motor activity could negatively affect competitive performance, creating a situation of unfairness among Para athletes belonging to the same sports class.Copyright © 2022 Puce, Bragazzi, Currà, Marinelli, Mori, Cotellessa, Chamari, Ponzano, Samanipour, Nikolaidis, Biz, Ruggieri and Trompetto.",

Materials and Methods: Thirty sedentary patients were selected for the project (25 males and 5 females), with a mean age of 73 ± 5 years (range 44-94 years). Twenty-five were implanted with a Pacemaker (PM) and five with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD). Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter was present in ten (34%) patients, post-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in five (17.2%), sick sinus syndrome in six (20,7%), complete atrium-ventricular block in six (20.7%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in one (3.4%) and recurrent syncope in one (3.4%). The baseline assessment comprised cardiovascular examination, resting and stress ECG, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (V ̇O2peak), strength assessment of different muscle groups, and a flexibility test. The same measurements were repeated after 15-20 consecutive training sessions, over a 2-month period. The exercise prescription was set to 70-80% of HRR (Heart rate reserve) and to 50-70% of 1RM (1-repetition maximum, muscular force). The training protocol consisted of two training sessions per week performed in our institute, 90 min for each (warm-up, aerobic phase, strength phase and stretching) and one or more at home autonomously. Results: The cardiopulmonary testing after the training period documents a significant improvement in V ̇O2peak (15 ± 4 mL/kg/min vs. 17 ± 4; p = 0.001) and in work load (87 ± 30 watts vs. 108 ± 37; p = 0.001). Additionally, strength capacity significantly increased after the cardiac rehabilitation program, (quadriceps: 21 ± 18 kg vs. 29 ± 16 kg, p = 0.00003). Flexibility tests show a positive trend, but without statistical significance (sit-and-reach test: -19 ± 11 cm vs. -15 ± 11.7 cm; back-scratch test: -19 ± 11.6 cm vs. -15 ± 10 cm; lateral flexibility right -44 ± 1.4 cm vs. -43 ± 9.5 cm; left -43 ± 5 vs. -45 ± 8.7 cm).

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate deep tendon reflex responses and associated electrophysiological parameters of the muscles in patients with fibromyalgia. This cross-sectional study included 38 patients with fibromyalgia and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Deep tendon reflexes of the rectus femoris and triceps brachii were tested using a reflex hammer. Electromyographic (amplitude and duration of activation), inertial measurement unit (angular velocity, acceleration), and electromechanical (delay) analyses were performed using a surface electromyography (sEMG) device. Comparative analyses were carried out between patients and controls. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of hyperreflexia in distinguishing fibromyalgia patients from controls. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the right/left rectus femoris and/or triceps brachii were observed in more than 85% (ranging from 86.8 to 94.7%) of the fibromyalgia group. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly increased deep tendon reflex responses compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients revealed significantly higher amplitude, longer duration of muscle activation, greater sagittal acceleration and angular velocity, and shorter electromechanical delay. Normalized muscle activation (right and left rectus femoris and right triceps brachii) in response to deep tendon reflex test showed acceptable ability in differentiating fibromyalgia patients from controls (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.890, 0.784 and 0.782, respectively). For the right rectus femoris, values ≤ 28.3 (clinically corresponding to normoactive/hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) appeared to rule-out fibromyalgia with 94.1% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibit increased deep tendon reflex responses. Normal or decreased deep tendon reflex responses may probably be used as a rule-out criterion for fibromyalgia.© 2025.

Single axial DTI and T1-weighted imaging of the right mid-thigh region were conducted before and after rest and stretching. Individual quadriceps were segmented, λ1-3 and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured using DTI, and the IntraMAT ratios were measured using T1-weighted imaging.

The correlation coefficients between the changing λ1-3 and FA magnitude by stretching and the IntaMAT ratio were assessed.There was a significant interventions-by-time interaction effect in the λ1-3 and FA in the vastus medialis (VM).

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week FW training program on jump performance, stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function, muscle strength, peak power and muscle thickness in collegiate basketball players. Twenty male college basketball players (mean age: 19.8 ± 1.3 years, height: 179.1 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 72.9 ± 6.3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the FW training (n = 11) or control group (n = 9). The FW training group performed squat exercises, 5 sets of 8 repetitions, twice a week using the FW device. Baseline and post-training assessments of jump heights of squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and drop jumps (DJs) were performed in both groups. Additionally, the reactive strength index (RSI), representing SSC function; isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque during knee joint extension; peak power during squats; and quadriceps muscle thickness were evaluated. As the results, we observed that the FW training group demonstrated significant increases in post-training SJ height (15.1%, p = 0.03), DJ height (23.2%, p = 0.01), RSI (36.8%, p = 0.04), MVC, peak power and muscle thickness compared with pre-training levels. Furthermore, between-group comparisons indicated significantly higher post-training SJ height, DJ height, RSI, MVC, peak power, and muscle thickness in the FW training group (p < 0.05). Therefore, the FW training program effectively enhanced jump performance and SSC function in male basketball players and proved beneficial for muscle strength and hypertrophy.© 2025 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "The imbalance of muscle strength indicators has a negative impact on players. Lower limb muscle imbalance can cause gait abnormalities and increase the risk of muscle injury or decreased performance in significantly asymmetrical situations. This study aims to assess the lower limb muscle imbalance and gait feature between the dominant and non-dominant sides of badminton players and the associations between the two variables.The study included 15 badminton players with years of training experience. Muscle strength and gait parameters were obtained from isokinetic muscle strength testing and plantar pressure analysis systems. The symmetry index was calculated based on formulas such as plantar pressure distribution and percentage of plantar contact area.In the isokinetic muscle strength test, significant differences were found in bilateral knee flexors' average power and total work at 60°/s angular speed. The hamstring to quadriceps ratio (H/Q) range of knee joints of the dominant and non-dominant sides is 0.63-0.74 at low speed, while the H/Q range is 0.81-0.88 at fast speed. The H/Q of bilateral knees increases with increasing angular velocity. As the angular velocity increases, the peak torque to body weight ratio (PT/BW) of the participants' bilateral knee flexors and extensors shows a decreasing trend. The asymmetry score of H/Q at 180°/s angular speed is positively related with step time and stance time. There are varying degrees of differences in gait staging parameters, plantar pressure in each area, plantar contact area, and symmetry index between the dominant and non-dominant sides of badminton players when walking.Badminton players have weaker flexors of the knee joint, imbalanced muscle strength in flexors and extensors, decreased lower limb stability, and a risk of knee joint injury on the non-dominant side. The bending and stretching strength of the knee joint on the dominant side of the players is greater than that on the non-dominant side. The pressure in the first metatarsal region of the dominant side is higher, while that in the midfoot and heel regions is higher on the non-dominant side. badminton players have better forward foot force and heel cushioning ability. Long term badminton sports result in specialized changes in plantar pressure distribution and reduced symmetry.Copyright © 2024 Huang, Xu, Bai, Yu, Mei and Gu.",

When an appropriate SS duration (<60-seconds per muscle) is incorporated into a dynamic warm-up, performance decrements are often trivial. However, there is a lack of studies that observed the effects of extensive SS (180-seconds) 2-hours prior to a dynamic warm-up. The objective was to investigate ROM and performance effects of prolonged SS, 2-hours prior to a traditional warm-up. This study investigated 9 female and 8 male healthy recreationally active, young adult participants on the effects of prolonged SS (180-seconds per muscle) of the quadriceps and hamstrings, 2-hours before a traditional warm-up compared to an active control condition on hip flexion ROM, knee extension and flexion MVIC forces, CMJ, DJ, and quadriceps and hamstrings electromyography (EMG). There were no significant changes in knee flexion/extension MVIC forces, EMG, CMJ, or DJ height.

Additionally, significant, large magnitude greater hip flexion ROM was observed with the women vs. men (ES: 1.29 - 1.34).

          "abstract": "Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) represents a promising technique for promoting functional recovery in individuals with neuromuscular diseases. Traditionally, current pulses are delivered through self-adhesive hydrogel Ag/AgCl electrodes, which allow a good contact with the skin, are easy-to-use and have a moderate cost. However, skin adherence decreases after a few uses and skin irritations can originate. Recently, textile electrodes have become an attractive alternative as they assure increased durability, easy integration into clothes and can be conveniently cleaned, improving the wearability of FES. However, as various manufacture processes were attempted, their clear validation is lacking. This proof-of-concept study proposes a novel set of ink-based printed textile electrodes and compares them to adhesive hydrogel electrodes in terms of impedance, stimulation performance and perceived comfort.The skin-electrode impedance was evaluated for both types of electrodes under different conditions. These electrodes were then used to deliver FES to the Rectus Femoris of 14 healthy subjects to induce its contraction in both isometric and dynamic conditions. This allowed to compare the two types of electrodes in terms of sensory, motor, maximum and pain thresholds, FES-induced range of motion during dynamic tests, FES-induced torque during isometric tests and perceived stimulation comfort.No statistically significant differences were found both in terms of stimulation performance (Wilcoxon test) and comfort (Generalized Linear Mixed Model).The results showed that the proposed ink-based printed textile electrodes can be effectively used as alternative to hydrogel ones.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

          "abstract": "Abnormal adherence at functional myofascial interfaces is hypothesized as an important phenomenon in myofascial pain syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities. The results provide a foundation for investigating the hypothesis that myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by changes in the mobility of myofascial interfaces.© 2024 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.",

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

In this work, we evaluated the effect of muscle passive stretch on shear wave propagation along and across the muscle fibers using a rotational 3D shear wave elasticity imaging system and automatic analysis methods. We imaged the vastus lateralis of 10 healthy volunteers, modulating passive stretch by imaging at 8 different knee flexion angles (controlled by a BioDex system). In addition to demonstrating the ability of this acquisition and automatic processing system to estimate muscle shear moduli over a range of values, we evaluated potential higher order biomarkers for muscle health that capture the change in muscle stiffness along and across the fibers with changing knee flexion. The median within-subject variability of these biomarkers is found to be <16%, suggesting promise as a repeatable clinical metric. Additionally, we report an unexpected observation: that shear wave signal amplitude along the fibers increases with increasing flexion and muscle stiffness, which is not predicted by transversely isotropic (TI) material simulations. This observation may point to an additional potential biomarker for muscle health or inform other material modeling choices for muscle.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an 8-week posterior and core strengthening program on APT, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio, and vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.Ten healthy males (age = 26±12 years; mass = 87±14 kg; height = 1.8±0.1 m) and nine healthy females (age = 22±4 years; mass = 70±14 kg; heigh t = 1.7±0.1 m) performed resistance training (2×/week; 40-45 mins) involving a combination of hip extensors and abdominal strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals.

For this purpose, we analyzed the Feeling Scale (FS) and Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) ratings using Time (during and after stretching) x Intensity (light, moderate, vigorous) x Stretched Muscle Group (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, latissimus dorsi, triceps) with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANCOVA) in 34 participants (21 males; aged 32.8 ± 8.6 years). The repeatability of FS and FAS ratings was assessed using two-way random-effects models, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. FS scores were higher following the stretching exercises, whereas FAS scores were lower, particularly in the vigorous intensity. In general, the inter-day repeatability for FS and FAS measurements was good across muscle groups. ICC tended to be higher at vigorous intensities. Ratings of core affect can be collected during static passive stretches using the FAS and FAS in ecologically valid settings.

          "title": "Physiology, Deep Tendon Reflexes",
          "abstract": "First described in 1875 by Wilhelm Heinrich Erb and Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal, the deep tendon reflex (DTR) is essential in examining and diagnosing neurologic disease. Deep tendon reflexes or, more accurately, the 'muscle stretch reflex' can aid in evaluating neurologic disease affecting afferent nerves, spinal cord synaptic connections, motor nerves, and descending motor pathways. Proper technique and interpretation of results are crucial in achieving a proper distinction between upper and lower motor neuron pathologic processes such as multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injuries, and spinal muscular atrophies, with the presence of hyporeflexia or hyperreflexia considered a 'hard sign' of neurologic dysfunction. There are five primary deep tendon reflexes: biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, patellar, and ankle. Biceps Reflex: Muscle involved: biceps brachii. Nerve supply: musculocutaneous. Segmental innervation: C5-C6. Brachioradialis Reflex: Muscle involved: brachioradialis. Nerve supply: radial. Segmental innervation: C5-C6. Triceps Reflex: Muscle involved: triceps brachii. Nerve supply: radial . Segmental innervation: C7-C8. Patellar Reflex (knee-jerk): Muscle involved: quadriceps femoris. Nerve supply: femoral. Segmental innervation: L2-L4. Achilles Reflex (ankle-jerk): Muscles involved: gastrocnemius, soleus. Nerve supply: tibial. Segmental innervation: S1-S2. To provide a standard scale for evaluating deep tendon reflexes, in 1993, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) proposed a grading scale from 0 to 4. This scale has been validated and is universally accepted. NINDS grading of deep tendon reflexes. 0: Reflex absent. 1: Reflex small, less than normal, includes a trace response or a response brought out only with reinforcement. 2: Reflex in the lower half of a normal range. 3: Reflex in the upper half of a normal range. 4: Reflex enhanced, more than normal, includes clonus if present, which optionally can be noted in an added verbal description of the reflex. In some instances, a plus sign (+) is written after the number. When discussing DTRs, adding or omitting a plus sign does not change the meaning of the reflex grade observed. What is 'normal' typically depends on the patient's history and past documented reflex grade. Abnormality is suggested when asymmetric reflexes are found. Once the examiner obtains a reflex on one side, they should test the same reflex on the opposite side for comparison.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 4 weeks of soleus stretching on ankle flexibility and dynamic balance, as well as selected monitoring and performance tests in soccer. Forty-five healthy female soccer players were randomly divided into a regular stretching group, a regular stretching group with soleus stretching, and a control group. Dynamic stretching protocols were performed for 4 weeks during three sessions per week as part of routine exercises. The regular group stretched three muscle groups (i.e., gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and hamstrings), while the regular + soleus group also stretched the soleus muscle. Before and after the stretching intervention, the ankle range of motion test, Y-balance test, drop jump test, dynamic knee valgus test, and Illinois Agility Running Test were performed. Ankle ROM, Y-balance, and DJ significantly improved in both intervention groups compared to controls. Only the regular + soleus group showed improvement in the Illinois Agility Running Test. Additionally, athletes performing the additional soleus stretching had greater improvements in ankle ROM and DJ but not in DKV or Y-balance. The results showed that adding soleus stretching into regular protocols can provide benefits for female soccer players in terms of performance parameters.",

          "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common public health problem and a leading cause of long-term pain, decreased muscle strength, and even disability. Tai Chi has been proved effective and highly recommended for KOA management worldwide. However, little is known about its benefits on quadriceps strength which is closely associated with relieving knee pain. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tai Chi on knee pain and muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults with KOA.A total of 100 participants will be randomly divided into a Tai Chi group (TC group) (1x/week for 12 weeks) and a control group with a health education and stretching program (1x/week for 12 weeks) with a follow-up period of 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscale at week 12 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include WOMAC stiffness and function subscales, data from isokinetic dynamometry, gait analysis with electromyography (EMG), and a 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). The daily dose of pain-relieving medication will also be recorded. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).We expect this randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi on relieving pain and increasing quadriceps strength in KOA patients. This protocol, if proven effective, will contribute to providing a promising alternative intervention for middle-aged and older adults with KOA.This trial has been registered in the China Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2300069339).© 2023.

          "abstract": "Hyperreflexia is common after neurological injury such as stroke, yet clinical interventions have had mixed success. Our previous research has shown that hyperreflexia of the rectus femoris (RF) during pre-swing is closely associated with reduced swing phase knee flexion in those with post-stroke Stiff-Knee gait (SKG). Thus, reduction of RF hyperreflexia may improve walking function in those with post-stroke SKG. A non-pharmacological procedure for reducing hyperreflexia has emerged based on operant conditioning of H-reflex, an electrical analog of the spinal stretch reflex. It is currently unknown whether operant conditioning can be applied to the RF. This feasibility study trained 7 participants (5 neurologically intact, 2 post-stroke) to down-condition the RF H-reflex using visual feedback. We found an overall decrease in average RF H-reflex amplitude among all 7 participants (44% drop, p < 0.001, paired t-test), of which the post-stroke individuals contributed (49% drop). We observed a generalized training effect across quadriceps muscles. Post-stroke individuals exhibited improvements in peak knee-flexion velocity, reflex excitability during walking, and clinical measures of spasticity. These outcomes provide promising initial results that operant RF H-reflex conditioning is feasible, encouraging expansion to post-stroke individuals. This procedure could provide a targeted alternative in spasticity management.© 2023. The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "This retrospective (case-control) collaborative study evaluates tendon reflex recordings combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials recordings (T-MEPs) at lower limbs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).T-MEPs were recorded in 97 ALS patients distinguished according to their patellar reflex briskness. Patients' electrophysiological data were compared with values measured in 60 control patients matched for age and height. Correlations studies between parameters or with some patients' clinical characteristics were also performed.The central motor conduction time yields the highest sensitivity (82%) and specificity (93%), allowing twice more upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction detection than clinical examination, and being more altered in late stages of the disease. The T response to MEP response amplitude ratio (T/MEP ar) is nearly as sensitive to detect ALS and better identifies abnormal hyperreflexia. It is not correlated with evolutive stage, contrarily to conduction time-related parameters. In addition, T-MEPs detect asymmetries escaping clinical examination.The corticospinal conduction to lower limbs is slowed in ALS. The T/MEP ar helps deciding when patellar reflexes are abnormal in a given patient suspected of ALS.The T-MEP technique provide powerful electrophysiological biomarkers of UMN involvement in ALS. This simple and painless procedure introduces the clinically useful concept of electrophysiological hyperreflexia and might be expanded to future exploration of proximal upper limbs and bulbar territories.Copyright © 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The first aim of this study was to investigate the association between the stiffness of the patellar and quadriceps tendon (PT, QT), gastrocnemius-Achilles tendon unit (GAT), and rectus femoris (RF) using drop jump (DJ) performance in young basketball players. The second aim was to investigate possible variations in the stiffness levels of those tissues in different developmental stages.The stiffness levels of the GAT, PT, QT, and RF were measured in both limbs in 73 male basketball players aged 12 to 18 years. The reactive strength index (RSI), contact time (CT) and jump height (JH) during 30 and 40 cm DJs were also measured.Pearson correlation coefficients showed a significant association between DJ performance and PT, QT, GAT, and RF dynamic stiffness. Moreover, the youngest subjects were found to have lower stiffness values than the older ones.Tissue stiffness can affect athletic performance by modifying the stretch-shortening cycle in young basketball players. Stiffness of muscles and tendons increases during the maturation process. Further investigations could shed light on the effect of training on the stiffness of muscles and tendons.",

Twenty older children (mean age: 14.2 years) with long-standing crouch gait secondary to cerebral diplegia underwent surgery to correct crouch gait that included the patellar tendon shortening. The technique for plicating the tendon differed for skeletally mature and immature patients. The length of the patellar tendon was measured by the Koshino Index. The strength of the quadriceps muscle was assessed by manual muscle testing and with a dynamometer and extensor lag, if present, was measured with a goniometer.

CASEs underwent corrective surgery for both the foot and knee deviations, inclusive of a QF aponeurectomy. Controls (CTRLs) underwent corrective surgery for foot deviations only. QF spasticity was assessed with the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) before and 1 month after surgery. The Wilcoxon test was used to assess MTS variations over time and the Mann-Whitney test was used to verify the presence of group differences at the 1 month mark.Ninety-three patients were included: 57 cases (30F, 1-34 years from lesion) and 36 controls (12F, 1-35 years from lesion). Before surgery, both CASEs and CTRLs had similar MTS scores (median MTS = 3) and functional characteristics. One month after surgery, QF spasticity was significantly lower in the CASEs compared to CTRLs (p = 0.033) due to a significant reduction of the median MTS score from 3 to 0 in the CASE group (p < 0.001) and no variations in the CTRL group (p = 0.468). About half of the cases attained clinically significant MTS reductions and complete symptom relief even many years from the stroke.Functional surgery inclusive of QF aponeurectomy can be effective in reducing or suppressing spasticity in chronic stroke patients.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the potential role of shear-wave elastography (SWE) in evaluating muscle quality and assess its association with muscle strength and mass.A total of 129 patients aged 18-87 years were included. Patients aged >65 years underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment. Anthropometric measurements, assessment of physical performance, muscle strength (handgrip strength [HGS]), muscle mass (B-mode muscle ultrasonography), and muscle quality (identified via SWE) were performed for all patients.The median (interquartile range) age of participants was 69 (59-76) years and 62% (n = 80) were female. According to HGS, patients were divided into normal and low HGS groups, and there were 85 (65.9%) and 44 (34.1%) patients in each group, respectively. The median average value of SWE measurement (Vmean ) of the rectus femoris (RF) in passive stretching was significantly lower in the low HGS group. In regression analyses, Vmean was significantly associated with HGS independently of age, sex, and body mass index. Optimal cutoff values of the Vmean value (m/s) of RF in passive stretching for predicting low HGS were ≤2.62 for male (area under the curve [AUC], 0.882; 95% CI, 0.705-0.938; P = <0.0001), and ≤2.52 for female (AUC, 0.719; 95% CI, 0.605-0.833; P = 0.002).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study revealing SWE is a good predictor of muscle strength, and it could be a useful tool for evaluating muscle quality in clinical practice.

          "abstract": "Faster walking speeds increase the demand on quadriceps muscles to produce adequate force to decelerate body mass and control knee flexion. Quadriceps fascicle behavior (i.e., fascicle length changes) influences force generation, which in turn affects mechanical loading of the articular cartilage during walking and the biochemical environment of the knee joint. The fascicle behavior underlying different walking speeds remains unclear but should be characterized to better understand how the quadriceps muscles accommodate faster walking speeds, speeds that often associate with better cartilage health outcomes. Our purpose was to quantify quadriceps muscle net fascicle length change during weight acceptance across a range of walking speeds in the context of more well-documented changes in muscle activity and knee joint moments. We hypothesized that vastus lateralis (VL) fascicles in healthy young adults would produce force with more overall lengthening in early stance at faster walking speeds with concomitant increases in muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengthening, internal peak knee extensor moment (pKEM), vertical ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activity. Participants walked for two-minute trials at their preferred speed and at 0.75 m/s and 1.75 m/s. We found that on average, the VL accommodates the greater mechanical demands of walking at faster speeds with greater muscle activity and while resisting muscle lengthening behavior. We infer then that tendon stretch accommodates MTU lengthening in healthy young adults across a range of speeds and suggest these results motivate additional studies aimed at evaluating VL fascicle behavior individuals with known quadriceps strength deficits, inhibition, or heightened risk for developing osteoarthritis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that a prevention program could decrease the incidence of LBP in high school volleyball players. This study was an in-season cluster-randomized controlled trial.We block-randomized 8 high school volleyball teams comprising 70 players aged 15 to 17 years into the intervention (4 teams, 34 players) and control (4 teams, 36 players) groups. The intervention program consisted of 9 physical function tests as well as 1 or 2 self-selected preventive exercises, including dynamic thoracic mobility, trunk stabilization exercises, and static stretching, performed during warm-up. Both groups were followed up for 4 weeks, during which the incidence of LBP was recorded. Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99).

However, due to the associated decoupling between MTU and muscle fascicle length changes, it remains unclear whether a rowing cycle causes active stretch at the muscle level. Fifteen young, sub-elite, male rowers (19.5 ± 1.6 yr; 1.94 ± 0.06 m; 91.9 ± 5.4 kg; rowing experience: 7.5 ± 2.8 yr) performed randomised 60-s rowing intervals using a traditional style at a low (LiR) and high intensity (HiR) and a micro-pause style at a low intensity (MpR). Muscle activity, knee joint angles, and muscle fascicle length changes from the left-sided vastus lateralis (VL) muscle were quantified using surface electromyography, inertial measurement units, and B-mode ultrasound imaging, respectively. All rowing conditions showed active fascicle stretch during late knee flexion (p≤0.001, standardised mean difference (SMD) ≥0.72) and subsequent active fascicle shortening throughout knee extension. Active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.49) were not significantly different (p≥0.174; SMD≤0.26) between LiR and MpR, but were significantly increased during HiR (p≤0.001; SMD≥0.70). The percentage of rowing cycles that involved active fascicle stretch (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.95; post-hoc: p≤0.001, SMD≥0.87) was also significantly higher for HiR (98.3 ±12.9%) compared with both LiR (65.0 ± 48.1%) and MpR (68.3 ± 46.9%). In conclusion, rowing involves SSC at the VL muscle fascicle level, but the amount of active stretch differs between rowing intensities, with the longest, largest, and fastest active stretch occurring during HiR. SSC-based mechanisms may therefore contribute more to rowing performance during HiR than LiR or MpR.HighlightsSurface electromyography and ultrasound imaging revealed stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) of the vastus lateralis muscle fascicles during rowingIncreased active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity from low- to high-intensity rowing indicate that SSC-based mechanisms likely contribute more to performance during high-intensity rowingThe SSC within the vastus lateralis muscle was independent of the rowing style at the same low rowing intensity.",

A recent hypothesis postulated that mechano-energetic microinjury of the primary afferent sensory neuron terminals in the muscle spindles, namely a transient Piezo2 channelopathy, could be the critical cause of delayed-onset muscle soreness in the form of a bi-phasic non-contact injury mechanism. This theory includes that this microlesion could delay the medium-latency response of the stretch reflex. Our aim with this study was to investigate this hypothesis. According to our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of delayed-onset muscle soreness on the medium-latency response of the stretch reflex. Our findings demonstrated that a significant delay in the medium-latency stretch reflex could be observed right after a multi-stage fitness test in the quadriceps femoris muscles of Hungarian professional handball players who consequently experienced delayed-onset muscle soreness. The long-latency stretch reflex and most likely short-latency stretch reflex were unaffected by delayed-onset muscle soreness in our study, which is in line with earlier findings. We translate these findings as indicative of proprioceptive Type Ia terminal microdamage in the muscle spindle in line with the aforementioned new acute non-contact compression axonopathy theory of delayed-onset muscles soreness.",

Muscle forces were estimated in OpenSim when hamstring optimal lengths changed in the range of 70-130% of the control case in 5% increments. The force and accumulated force of quadriceps muscle were calculated to evaluate the impact of hamstring optimal lengths on the loading on tibial tuberosity. The changes in muscle forces throughout the gait cycle were compared by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The average peak force and accumulated force of five gait cycles were compared.Although the maximum force of the quadriceps muscle was slightly affected by changes in hamstring optimal lengths, the accumulated force of quadriceps muscle increased by 21.97% with hamstring optimal lengths decreased by 30% of the control case. The increase of the muscle force mainly occurred in the early stance phase and terminal swing phase (P < 0.05). However, when hamstring optimal lengths were longer than the control, it had a little effect on accumulated force of quadriceps muscle.The results of this study indicate that a shorter hamstring optimal length, which means lack of flexibility, can cause a high accumulated force on tibial tuberosity, thus increasing the risk of OSD.

          "title": "Residual force enhancement is affected more by quadriceps muscle length than stretch amplitude.",
          "abstract": "Little is known about how muscle length affects residual force enhancement (rFE) in humans. We therefore investigated rFE at short, long, and very long muscle lengths within the human quadriceps and patellar tendon (PT) using conventional dynamometry with motion capture (rFETQ) and a new, non-invasive shear-wave tensiometry technique (rFEWS). Eleven healthy male participants performed submaximal (50% max.) EMG-matched fixed-end reference and stretch-hold contractions across these muscle lengths while muscle fascicle length changes of the vastus lateralis (VL) were captured using B-mode ultrasound. We found significant rFETQ at long (7±5%) and very long (12±8%), but not short (2±5%) muscle lengths, whereas rFEWS was only significant at the very long (38±27%), but not short (8±12%) or long (6±10%) muscle lengths. We also found significant relationships between VL fascicle length and rFETQ (r=0.63, p=0.001) and rFEWS (r=0.52, p=0.017), but relationships were not significant between VL fascicle stretch amplitude and rFETQ (r=0.33, p=0.126) or rFEWS (r=0.29, p=0.201). Squared PT shear-wave-speed-angle relationships did not agree with estimated PT force-angle relationships, which indicates that estimating PT loads from shear-wave tensiometry might be inaccurate. We conclude that increasing muscle length rather than stretch amplitude contributes more to rFE during submaximal voluntary contractions of the human quadriceps.© 2022, Bakenecker et al.",

          "abstract": "Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS), also known as the distal arthrogryposis (DA) type 2A, is a rare congenital anomaly. We report a unique case of the DA type 2A with mixed clinical features and the unusual presentation of bilateral congenital dislocation of the knee but had unassisted stiff knee gait.A 5-year-old female child presented to the clinic with the complaint of inability to bend both knees since birth. She had an unassisted bipedal gait, but could not squat, cross-leg sit, run, and climb stairs without assistance. Her youngest brother had a similar presentation but succumbed to death at the age of 5 months due to respiratory distress. Clinical features were in the favor of FSS. Her serum creatinine kinase level was normal and the electromyography of bilateral tibialis anterior and abductor pollicis brevis was not suggestive of the myotonia. Radiograph of the skull showed cooper beaten skull appearance whereas bilateral pelvis with the hip showed following changes in the right hip; decrease femoral epiphysis height, horizontal proximal femoral physis, and the coxa brevia. She was initially managed conservatively by weekly stretching, manipulation, and casting. As a result, she could flex her knee up to 20°. Although the quadricepsplasty might be helpful for the persistent extension deformity, there was marked quadriceps weakness which could make it harder for the child to stand and walk. In addition, the abnormal muscle physiology in FSS may result in unfavorable outcomes after the surgery. Moreover, a consideration of the surgical aspect is not free of risks which include difficult endotracheal intubation, vein access, and malignant hyperthermia.FSS is a rare congenital anomaly that should be differentiated from another syndrome of the close resemblance, Sheldon Hall syndrome and Schwartz Jampel syndrome which are other rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by myotonia and the chondrodysplasia. Conservative management has still a role in bilateral knee involvement especially if the patient is an independent walker.Copyright: © Indian Orthopaedic Research Group.",

Thirtheen healthy participants (both genders) proposed for a pre-post experimental design. RF, VM, and VL elasticity (strain ratio, SR) was evaluated bilaterally by ultrasound with quasi-static elastography. Higher SR values refer to more rigid tissues. A SS protocol of 3 series of 30 s was applied at right lower limb. The left lower limb was considered as control group. Also, photogrammetry evaluated the knee/hip ROM.For SR muscle comparisons, VM was lower (less stiff) than VL and RF at pre- and post-SS. For time comparisons, no differences were observed for SR and ROM at pre- and post-SS. However, the effect size of the quadriceps SR at SS lower limb was higher than control.Acute effects of SS did not change the quadriceps SR or knee/hip ROM in healthy and active subjects. Non-uniform quadriceps SR are observed (VM < VL and RF) independently of SS. Future studies should consider different protocols, muscles, and populations.© 2022.

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigated the effects of flywheel squat training on lower body muscle function adaptations and sport-specific performance in collegiate club water polo players. Methods: Thirteen collegiate club water polo athletes (5 women, 8 men) performed flywheel squat training for 4 weeks. Isokinetic knee extension (KE) peak power (PP) and peak torque (PT), flywheel squat peak power (FPP) and mean power (FMP), countermovement jump (CMJ), in-water jump height (WJH) and foot speed were assessed at baseline (Pre1), 4 weeks (Pre2), and 8 weeks (Post) with the first 4 week block being a control period and the second 4 week block being the experimental training. Throughout the training period muscle soreness was assessed using a VAS scale, and FPP and FMP were assessed during every other session. Results: Isokinetic KE PP and PT increased from Pre1 to Post, and FPP and FMP increased between Pre1 and Post, and Pre2 and Post. CMJ and foot speed were unchanged. WJH displayed a change between Pre1 and Post. FPP increased 19% from session 2 to 4 and FMP increased 27% from session 2 to 6, and each remained elevated through session 8. Conclusion: 4 weeks of flywheel squat training in collegiate club water polo players elicited large gains (47-52%) in flywheel-specific squat power, but did not influence sport-specific performance measures including CMJ, WJH, and foot speed. Water-based exercises and stretch-shortening cycle movements (plyometrics) in combination with effective resistance training programs, which may include flywheel-based training, are likely needed for marked sport skill improvements.",

          "abstract": "Sarcopenia is defined by the loss of muscle mass and function. In aging sarcopenia is due to mild chronic inflammation but also to fiber-intrinsic defects, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. Age-related sarcopenia is associated with physical disability and lowered quality of life. In addition to skeletal muscle, the nervous tissue is also affected in elderly people. With aging, type 2 fast fibers preferentially undergo denervation and are reinnervated by slow-twitch motor neurons. They spread forming new neuro-muscular junctions with the denervated fibers: the result is an increased proportion of slow fibers that group together since they are associated in the same motor unit. Grouping and fiber type shifting are indeed major histological features of aging skeletal muscle. Exercise has been proposed as an intervention for age-related sarcopenia due to its numerous beneficial effects on muscle mechanical and biochemical features. In 2013, a precursor study in humans was published in the European Journal of Translation Myology (formerly known as Basic and Applied Myology), highlighting the occurrence of reinnervation in the musculature of aged, exercise-trained individuals as compared to the matching control. This paper, entitled «Reinnervation of Vastus lateralis is increased significantly in seniors (70-years old) with a lifelong history of high-level exercise», is now being reprinted for the second issue of the «Ejtm Seminal Paper Series».

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate deep tendon reflex responses and associated electrophysiological parameters of the muscles in patients with fibromyalgia. This cross-sectional study included 38 patients with fibromyalgia and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Deep tendon reflexes of the rectus femoris and triceps brachii were tested using a reflex hammer. Electromyographic (amplitude and duration of activation), inertial measurement unit (angular velocity, acceleration), and electromechanical (delay) analyses were performed using a surface electromyography (sEMG) device. Comparative analyses were carried out between patients and controls. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of hyperreflexia in distinguishing fibromyalgia patients from controls. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the right/left rectus femoris and/or triceps brachii were observed in more than 85% (ranging from 86.8 to 94.7%) of the fibromyalgia group. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly increased deep tendon reflex responses compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients revealed significantly higher amplitude, longer duration of muscle activation, greater sagittal acceleration and angular velocity, and shorter electromechanical delay. Normalized muscle activation (right and left rectus femoris and right triceps brachii) in response to deep tendon reflex test showed acceptable ability in differentiating fibromyalgia patients from controls (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.890, 0.784 and 0.782, respectively). For the right rectus femoris, values ≤ 28.3 (clinically corresponding to normoactive/hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) appeared to rule-out fibromyalgia with 94.1% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibit increased deep tendon reflex responses. Normal or decreased deep tendon reflex responses may probably be used as a rule-out criterion for fibromyalgia.© 2025.

          "abstract": "In vitro experiments define passive force enhancement as the increase in steady-state passive force following the deactivation of an actively stretched muscle, in contrast to a purely passive stretch. This phenomenon, linked to residual force enhancement, is also observed in voluntarily contracted muscles as passive residual torque enhancement (RTEpass). While mechanisms remain unclear, titin stiffness likey plays a key role. Supersonic shear wave elastography (SSI) estimates tissue stiffness via the shear modulus (μ). The study aimed to assess whether RTEpass of the knee extensor muscles is accompanied by an increase in vastus lateralis stiffness (RμEpass) as measured by shear wave elastography. Passive torque was measured in 20 healthy young adults at a knee flexion angle of 100° before and after both isometric contractions (control protocol) and isometric contractions preceded by an eccentric contraction at 30°/s (from 70° to 100°). The comparison of protocols revealed a significant mean RTEpass of 1.03 N·m (16.5 %; p < 0.001), confirming the RTEpass in knee extensors. Although the experimental protocol showed a significant change in μ from the Before- to Post-contraction moment (5.89 %; p = 0.041), no differences in μ were observed between protocols at any post-contraction moments (p ≥ 0.191). Spearman correlation analysis indicated a weak, non-significant correlation between RTEpass and RμEpass (rs = 0.219; p = 0.352). These findings suggest that changes in vastus lateralis stiffness, as measured by SSI, are insufficient to explain RTEpass. While the literature identifies titin as a primary mechanism for passive residual torque enhancement, SSI elastography did not detect this phenomenon through solely vastus lateralis stiffness.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Single axial DTI and T1-weighted imaging of the right mid-thigh region were conducted before and after rest and stretching.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week FW training program on jump performance, stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function, muscle strength, peak power and muscle thickness in collegiate basketball players. Twenty male college basketball players (mean age: 19.8 ± 1.3 years, height: 179.1 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 72.9 ± 6.3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the FW training (n = 11) or control group (n = 9). The FW training group performed squat exercises, 5 sets of 8 repetitions, twice a week using the FW device. Baseline and post-training assessments of jump heights of squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and drop jumps (DJs) were performed in both groups. Additionally, the reactive strength index (RSI), representing SSC function; isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque during knee joint extension; peak power during squats; and quadriceps muscle thickness were evaluated. As the results, we observed that the FW training group demonstrated significant increases in post-training SJ height (15.1%, p = 0.03), DJ height (23.2%, p = 0.01), RSI (36.8%, p = 0.04), MVC, peak power and muscle thickness compared with pre-training levels. Furthermore, between-group comparisons indicated significantly higher post-training SJ height, DJ height, RSI, MVC, peak power, and muscle thickness in the FW training group (p < 0.05). Therefore, the FW training program effectively enhanced jump performance and SSC function in male basketball players and proved beneficial for muscle strength and hypertrophy.© 2025 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "Ely's, Ober's, and modified Thomas' tests are widely used. Stretching the front thigh involves two layers of tissue: the rectus femoris and its overlying fascia lata (FL). However, to our knowledge, no biomechanical study has analyzed these tests. Therefore, this study tries to determine the structures affected during the stretching of the front thigh.An observational study of the front thigh was conducted. The directions and intensities of the reaction forces were recorded. The patellar travel was used to determine the average coordinates of the stretched structures at hip level in the horizontal plane. The participants indicated the stretched area. The stretch of a patient with a complete tear of his left rectus femoris was recorded.The reaction force of the thigh was oriented at 33° (standard deviation [SD]: 6°) sideways and its intensity was 60 N m (SD: 19 N m). The centroid coordinates of all stretched structures were stable. The registered average external rotational torque of 6 N m (SD: 3.7 N m) could only be mediated by the FL. The stretched area indicated by the participants could be anywhere on the FL. The tolerated reaction force increased in the same way on the disinserted rectus femoris thigh and on the uninjured thigh.Ober's, Modified Thomas', and Ely's tests are three potential means of assessing FL extensibility.

Lower limb muscle imbalance can cause gait abnormalities and increase the risk of muscle injury or decreased performance in significantly asymmetrical situations. This study aims to assess the lower limb muscle imbalance and gait feature between the dominant and non-dominant sides of badminton players and the associations between the two variables.The study included 15 badminton players with years of training experience. Muscle strength and gait parameters were obtained from isokinetic muscle strength testing and plantar pressure analysis systems. The symmetry index was calculated based on formulas such as plantar pressure distribution and percentage of plantar contact area.In the isokinetic muscle strength test, significant differences were found in bilateral knee flexors' average power and total work at 60°/s angular speed. The hamstring to quadriceps ratio (H/Q) range of knee joints of the dominant and non-dominant sides is 0.63-0.74 at low speed, while the H/Q range is 0.81-0.88 at fast speed. The H/Q of bilateral knees increases with increasing angular velocity. As the angular velocity increases, the peak torque to body weight ratio (PT/BW) of the participants' bilateral knee flexors and extensors shows a decreasing trend. The asymmetry score of H/Q at 180°/s angular speed is positively related with step time and stance time. There are varying degrees of differences in gait staging parameters, plantar pressure in each area, plantar contact area, and symmetry index between the dominant and non-dominant sides of badminton players when walking.Badminton players have weaker flexors of the knee joint, imbalanced muscle strength in flexors and extensors, decreased lower limb stability, and a risk of knee joint injury on the non-dominant side. The bending and stretching strength of the knee joint on the dominant side of the players is greater than that on the non-dominant side. The pressure in the first metatarsal region of the dominant side is higher, while that in the midfoot and heel regions is higher on the non-dominant side. badminton players have better forward foot force and heel cushioning ability. Long term badminton sports result in specialized changes in plantar pressure distribution and reduced symmetry.Copyright © 2024 Huang, Xu, Bai, Yu, Mei and Gu.",

Effects of different stretching modalities on the antagonist and agonist muscles on isokinetic strength and vertical jump performance in young men. J Strength Cond Res 39(2): 173-183, 2025-Exercise warm-up may include static or dynamic stretching, impacting performance differently. This study investigated the effects of various stretching protocols on isokinetic strength, muscular activity, and vertical jump performance. Sixteen subjects, divided evenly between trained and untrained groups, underwent 8 distinct stretching conditions in random order. Outcomes measured included isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque and power, muscular activity (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and biceps femoris), and jump performance (jump height and modified reactive strength index [RSImod]). Responses to the stretching conditions were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach. For isokinetic knee extension, dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist (DY-AG-ANT) and combined dynamic agonist with static antagonist stretching (DY-AG ST-ANT) produced significant improvements. Dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist increased peak torque by 12.72% and average torque by 30.80%, while DY-AG ST-ANT increased peak torque by 15.61% and average torque by 41.06%. Muscular activity also improved significantly; DY-AG ST-ANT increased EMG activity of the vastus lateralis by 29.43% and vastus medialis by 70.75%. Biceps femoris saw a 33.18% increase with DY-AG and a 22.15% increase with ST-AG. Countermovement jump height improved with DY-AG-ANT (12.6%) and static antagonist (ST-ANT) conditions (11.3%) ( p < 0.05). Dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist also enhanced average power knee extension by 32.41%, while ST-AG DY-ANT improved it by 31.09% ( p < 0.05). Dynamic stretching, especially when combined with static stretching, optimizes isokinetic strength, muscular activity, and jump height.

When an appropriate SS duration (<60-seconds per muscle) is incorporated into a dynamic warm-up, performance decrements are often trivial. However, there is a lack of studies that observed the effects of extensive SS (180-seconds) 2-hours prior to a dynamic warm-up. The objective was to investigate ROM and performance effects of prolonged SS, 2-hours prior to a traditional warm-up. This study investigated 9 female and 8 male healthy recreationally active, young adult participants on the effects of prolonged SS (180-seconds per muscle) of the quadriceps and hamstrings, 2-hours before a traditional warm-up compared to an active control condition on hip flexion ROM, knee extension and flexion MVIC forces, CMJ, DJ, and quadriceps and hamstrings electromyography (EMG). There were no significant changes in knee flexion/extension MVIC forces, EMG, CMJ, or DJ height.

          "title": "Fatiguing exercise reduces cellular passive Young's modulus in human vastus lateralis muscle.",
          "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrated that acute fatiguing exercise transiently reduces whole-muscle stiffness, which might contribute to increased risk of injury and impaired contractile performance. We sought to elucidate potential intracellular mechanisms underlying these reductions. To that end, the cellular passive Young's modulus was measured in muscle fibres from healthy, young males and females. Eight volunteers (four male and four female) completed unilateral, repeated maximal voluntary knee extensions until task failure, immediately followed by bilateral percutaneous needle muscle biopsy of the post-fatigued followed by the non-fatigued control vastus lateralis. Muscle samples were processed for mechanical assessment and separately for imaging and phosphoproteomics. Fibres were passively (pCa 8.0) stretched incrementally to 156% of initial sarcomere length to assess Young's modulus, calculated as the slope of the resulting stress-strain curve at short (sarcomere length = 2.4-3.0 µm) and long (sarcomere length = 3.2-3.8 µm) lengths. Titin phosphorylation was assessed by liquid chromatography followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The passive modulus was significantly reduced in post-fatigued versus control fibres from male, but not female, participants. Post-fatigued samples showed altered phosphorylation of five serine residues (four located within the elastic region of titin) but did not exhibit altered active tension or sarcomere ultrastructure. Collectively, these results suggest that acute fatigue is sufficient to alter phosphorylation of skeletal titin in multiple locations. We also found reductions in the passive modulus, consistent with prior reports in the literature investigating striated muscle stiffness. These results provide mechanistic insight contributing to the understanding of dynamic regulation of whole-muscle tissue mechanics in vivo. HIGHLIGHTS: What is the central question of this study? Previous studies have shown that skeletal muscle stiffness is reduced following a single bout of fatiguing exercise in whole muscle, but it is not known whether these changes manifest at the cellular level, and their potential mechanisms remain unexplored. What is the main finding and its importance? Fatiguing exercise reduces cellular stiffness in skeletal muscle from males but not females, suggesting that fatigue alters tissue compliance in a sex-dependent manner. The phosphorylation status of titin, a potential mediator of skeletal muscle cellular stiffness, is modified by fatiguing exercise. Previous studies have shown that passive skeletal muscle stiffness is reduced following a single bout of fatiguing exercise. Lower muscle passive stiffness following fatiguing exercise might increase risk for soft-tissue injury; however, the underlying mechanisms of this change are unclear. Our findings show that fatiguing exercise reduces the passive Young's modulus in skeletal muscle cells from males but not females, suggesting that intracellular proteins contribute to reduced muscle stiffness following repeated loading to task failure in a sex-dependent manner. The phosphorylation status of the intracellular protein titin is modified by fatiguing exercise in a way that might contribute to altered muscle stiffness after fatiguing exercise. These results provide important mechanistic insight that might help to explain why biological sex impacts the risk for soft-tissue injury with repeated or high-intensity mechanical loading in athletes and the risk of falls in older adults.© 2024 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) represents a promising technique for promoting functional recovery in individuals with neuromuscular diseases. Traditionally, current pulses are delivered through self-adhesive hydrogel Ag/AgCl electrodes, which allow a good contact with the skin, are easy-to-use and have a moderate cost. However, skin adherence decreases after a few uses and skin irritations can originate. Recently, textile electrodes have become an attractive alternative as they assure increased durability, easy integration into clothes and can be conveniently cleaned, improving the wearability of FES. However, as various manufacture processes were attempted, their clear validation is lacking. This proof-of-concept study proposes a novel set of ink-based printed textile electrodes and compares them to adhesive hydrogel electrodes in terms of impedance, stimulation performance and perceived comfort.The skin-electrode impedance was evaluated for both types of electrodes under different conditions. These electrodes were then used to deliver FES to the Rectus Femoris of 14 healthy subjects to induce its contraction in both isometric and dynamic conditions. This allowed to compare the two types of electrodes in terms of sensory, motor, maximum and pain thresholds, FES-induced range of motion during dynamic tests, FES-induced torque during isometric tests and perceived stimulation comfort.No statistically significant differences were found both in terms of stimulation performance (Wilcoxon test) and comfort (Generalized Linear Mixed Model).The results showed that the proposed ink-based printed textile electrodes can be effectively used as alternative to hydrogel ones.

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

          "abstract": "Abnormal adherence at functional myofascial interfaces is hypothesized as an important phenomenon in myofascial pain syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities. The results provide a foundation for investigating the hypothesis that myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by changes in the mobility of myofascial interfaces.© 2024 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.",

We investigated application of a conductive electroactive polymer sensor as a novel wearable surface mechanomyography (sMMG) sensor for quantifying muscle contractility. The radial displacement of a muscle during a contraction is detected by the physically stretched dielectric elastomer component of the sMMG sensor which quantifies the changes in capacitance. The duration of muscle activation times for quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles demonstrated strong correlation between sMMG and EMG during a parallel squat activity and isometric contractions.

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

In this work, we evaluated the effect of muscle passive stretch on shear wave propagation along and across the muscle fibers using a rotational 3D shear wave elasticity imaging system and automatic analysis methods. We imaged the vastus lateralis of 10 healthy volunteers, modulating passive stretch by imaging at 8 different knee flexion angles (controlled by a BioDex system). In addition to demonstrating the ability of this acquisition and automatic processing system to estimate muscle shear moduli over a range of values, we evaluated potential higher order biomarkers for muscle health that capture the change in muscle stiffness along and across the fibers with changing knee flexion. The median within-subject variability of these biomarkers is found to be <16%, suggesting promise as a repeatable clinical metric. Additionally, we report an unexpected observation: that shear wave signal amplitude along the fibers increases with increasing flexion and muscle stiffness, which is not predicted by transversely isotropic (TI) material simulations. This observation may point to an additional potential biomarker for muscle health or inform other material modeling choices for muscle.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals.

For this purpose, we analyzed the Feeling Scale (FS) and Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) ratings using Time (during and after stretching) x Intensity (light, moderate, vigorous) x Stretched Muscle Group (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, latissimus dorsi, triceps) with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANCOVA) in 34 participants (21 males; aged 32.8 ± 8.6 years). The repeatability of FS and FAS ratings was assessed using two-way random-effects models, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. FS scores were higher following the stretching exercises, whereas FAS scores were lower, particularly in the vigorous intensity. In general, the inter-day repeatability for FS and FAS measurements was good across muscle groups. ICC tended to be higher at vigorous intensities. Ratings of core affect can be collected during static passive stretches using the FAS and FAS in ecologically valid settings.

          "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common public health problem and a leading cause of long-term pain, decreased muscle strength, and even disability. Tai Chi has been proved effective and highly recommended for KOA management worldwide. However, little is known about its benefits on quadriceps strength which is closely associated with relieving knee pain. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tai Chi on knee pain and muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults with KOA.A total of 100 participants will be randomly divided into a Tai Chi group (TC group) (1x/week for 12 weeks) and a control group with a health education and stretching program (1x/week for 12 weeks) with a follow-up period of 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscale at week 12 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include WOMAC stiffness and function subscales, data from isokinetic dynamometry, gait analysis with electromyography (EMG), and a 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). The daily dose of pain-relieving medication will also be recorded. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).We expect this randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi on relieving pain and increasing quadriceps strength in KOA patients. This protocol, if proven effective, will contribute to providing a promising alternative intervention for middle-aged and older adults with KOA.This trial has been registered in the China Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2300069339).© 2023.

          "abstract": "Hyperreflexia is common after neurological injury such as stroke, yet clinical interventions have had mixed success. Our previous research has shown that hyperreflexia of the rectus femoris (RF) during pre-swing is closely associated with reduced swing phase knee flexion in those with post-stroke Stiff-Knee gait (SKG). Thus, reduction of RF hyperreflexia may improve walking function in those with post-stroke SKG. A non-pharmacological procedure for reducing hyperreflexia has emerged based on operant conditioning of H-reflex, an electrical analog of the spinal stretch reflex. It is currently unknown whether operant conditioning can be applied to the RF. This feasibility study trained 7 participants (5 neurologically intact, 2 post-stroke) to down-condition the RF H-reflex using visual feedback. We found an overall decrease in average RF H-reflex amplitude among all 7 participants (44% drop, p < 0.001, paired t-test), of which the post-stroke individuals contributed (49% drop). We observed a generalized training effect across quadriceps muscles. Post-stroke individuals exhibited improvements in peak knee-flexion velocity, reflex excitability during walking, and clinical measures of spasticity. These outcomes provide promising initial results that operant RF H-reflex conditioning is feasible, encouraging expansion to post-stroke individuals. This procedure could provide a targeted alternative in spasticity management.© 2023. The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "Wearable assistive technology for the lower extremities has shown great promise towards improving gait function in people with neuromuscular injuries. But common secondary impairments, such as hypersensitive stretch reflexes or hyperreflexia, have been often neglected. Incorporation of biomechanics into the control loop could improve individualization and avoid hyperreflexia. However, adding hyperreflexia prediction to the control loop would require expensive or complex measurement of muscle fiber characteristics. In this study, we explore a clinically accessible biomechanical predictor set that can accurately predict rectus femoris (RF) reaction after knee flexion assistance in pre-swing by a powered orthosis. We examined a total of 14 gait parameters based on gait kinematic, kinetic, and simulated muscle-tendon states from 8 post-stroke individuals with Stiff-Knee gait (SKG) wearing a knee exoskeleton robot. We independently performed both parametric and non-parametric variable selection approaches using machine learning regression techniques. Both models revealed the same four kinematic variables relevant to knee and hip joint motions were sufficient to effectively predict RF hyperreflexia. These results suggest that control of knee and hip kinematics may be a more practical method of incorporating quadriceps hyperreflexia into the exoskeleton control loop than the more complex acquisition of muscle fiber properties.© 2023.

The first aim of this study was to investigate the association between the stiffness of the patellar and quadriceps tendon (PT, QT), gastrocnemius-Achilles tendon unit (GAT), and rectus femoris (RF) using drop jump (DJ) performance in young basketball players. The second aim was to investigate possible variations in the stiffness levels of those tissues in different developmental stages.The stiffness levels of the GAT, PT, QT, and RF were measured in both limbs in 73 male basketball players aged 12 to 18 years. The reactive strength index (RSI), contact time (CT) and jump height (JH) during 30 and 40 cm DJs were also measured.Pearson correlation coefficients showed a significant association between DJ performance and PT, QT, GAT, and RF dynamic stiffness. Moreover, the youngest subjects were found to have lower stiffness values than the older ones.Tissue stiffness can affect athletic performance by modifying the stretch-shortening cycle in young basketball players. Stiffness of muscles and tendons increases during the maturation process. Further investigations could shed light on the effect of training on the stiffness of muscles and tendons.",

Our aim was to ascertain whether the corrected position of the patella and improvement of the power of the quadriceps were maintained for 4 years or more. Twenty older children (mean age: 14.2 years) with long-standing crouch gait secondary to cerebral diplegia underwent surgery to correct crouch gait that included the patellar tendon shortening. The technique for plicating the tendon differed for skeletally mature and immature patients. The length of the patellar tendon was measured by the Koshino Index. The strength of the quadriceps muscle was assessed by manual muscle testing and with a dynamometer and extensor lag, if present, was measured with a goniometer. In all 40 knees, the patella was brought to a more distal position and the position was maintained for a mean duration of 84 months (Koshino Index: preoperative 1.3 ± 0.10; 3-month postoperative 0.95 ± 0.05; final follow-up 0.95 ± 0.04). The results were the same for the techniques used for skeletally mature and immature patients. The power of the quadriceps improved [Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 3 to MRC grade 4] and the improvement was maintained.

CASEs underwent corrective surgery for both the foot and knee deviations, inclusive of a QF aponeurectomy. Controls (CTRLs) underwent corrective surgery for foot deviations only. QF spasticity was assessed with the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) before and 1 month after surgery. The Wilcoxon test was used to assess MTS variations over time and the Mann-Whitney test was used to verify the presence of group differences at the 1 month mark.Ninety-three patients were included: 57 cases (30F, 1-34 years from lesion) and 36 controls (12F, 1-35 years from lesion). Before surgery, both CASEs and CTRLs had similar MTS scores (median MTS = 3) and functional characteristics. One month after surgery, QF spasticity was significantly lower in the CASEs compared to CTRLs (p = 0.033) due to a significant reduction of the median MTS score from 3 to 0 in the CASE group (p < 0.001) and no variations in the CTRL group (p = 0.468). About half of the cases attained clinically significant MTS reductions and complete symptom relief even many years from the stroke.Functional surgery inclusive of QF aponeurectomy can be effective in reducing or suppressing spasticity in chronic stroke patients.

Anthropometric measurements, assessment of physical performance, muscle strength (handgrip strength [HGS]), muscle mass (B-mode muscle ultrasonography), and muscle quality (identified via SWE) were performed for all patients.The median (interquartile range) age of participants was 69 (59-76) years and 62% (n = 80) were female.

          "abstract": "Faster walking speeds increase the demand on quadriceps muscles to produce adequate force to decelerate body mass and control knee flexion. Quadriceps fascicle behavior (i.e., fascicle length changes) influences force generation, which in turn affects mechanical loading of the articular cartilage during walking and the biochemical environment of the knee joint. The fascicle behavior underlying different walking speeds remains unclear but should be characterized to better understand how the quadriceps muscles accommodate faster walking speeds, speeds that often associate with better cartilage health outcomes. Our purpose was to quantify quadriceps muscle net fascicle length change during weight acceptance across a range of walking speeds in the context of more well-documented changes in muscle activity and knee joint moments. We hypothesized that vastus lateralis (VL) fascicles in healthy young adults would produce force with more overall lengthening in early stance at faster walking speeds with concomitant increases in muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengthening, internal peak knee extensor moment (pKEM), vertical ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activity. Participants walked for two-minute trials at their preferred speed and at 0.75 m/s and 1.75 m/s. We found that on average, the VL accommodates the greater mechanical demands of walking at faster speeds with greater muscle activity and while resisting muscle lengthening behavior. We infer then that tendon stretch accommodates MTU lengthening in healthy young adults across a range of speeds and suggest these results motivate additional studies aimed at evaluating VL fascicle behavior individuals with known quadriceps strength deficits, inhibition, or heightened risk for developing osteoarthritis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The intervention program consisted of 9 physical function tests as well as 1 or 2 self-selected preventive exercises, including dynamic thoracic mobility, trunk stabilization exercises, and static stretching, performed during warm-up. Both groups were followed up for 4 weeks, during which the incidence of LBP was recorded. Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99).

          "abstract": "A rowing cycle is characterised by a stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) at the quadriceps femoris muscle-tendon unit (MTU) level. However, due to the associated decoupling between MTU and muscle fascicle length changes, it remains unclear whether a rowing cycle causes active stretch at the muscle level. Fifteen young, sub-elite, male rowers (19.5 ± 1.6 yr; 1.94 ± 0.06 m; 91.9 ± 5.4 kg; rowing experience: 7.5 ± 2.8 yr) performed randomised 60-s rowing intervals using a traditional style at a low (LiR) and high intensity (HiR) and a micro-pause style at a low intensity (MpR). Muscle activity, knee joint angles, and muscle fascicle length changes from the left-sided vastus lateralis (VL) muscle were quantified using surface electromyography, inertial measurement units, and B-mode ultrasound imaging, respectively. All rowing conditions showed active fascicle stretch during late knee flexion (p≤0.001, standardised mean difference (SMD) ≥0.72) and subsequent active fascicle shortening throughout knee extension. Active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.49) were not significantly different (p≥0.174; SMD≤0.26) between LiR and MpR, but were significantly increased during HiR (p≤0.001; SMD≥0.70). The percentage of rowing cycles that involved active fascicle stretch (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.95; post-hoc: p≤0.001, SMD≥0.87) was also significantly higher for HiR (98.3 ±12.9%) compared with both LiR (65.0 ± 48.1%) and MpR (68.3 ± 46.9%). In conclusion, rowing involves SSC at the VL muscle fascicle level, but the amount of active stretch differs between rowing intensities, with the longest, largest, and fastest active stretch occurring during HiR. SSC-based mechanisms may therefore contribute more to rowing performance during HiR than LiR or MpR.HighlightsSurface electromyography and ultrasound imaging revealed stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) of the vastus lateralis muscle fascicles during rowingIncreased active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity from low- to high-intensity rowing indicate that SSC-based mechanisms likely contribute more to performance during high-intensity rowingThe SSC within the vastus lateralis muscle was independent of the rowing style at the same low rowing intensity.",

Participants received one of the following interventions: standard treatment (ST group, n = 20), ST + PNF training (ST + PNF group, n = 20), ST + PNF training + TEAS intervention (ST + PNF + TEAS group, n = 20). All treatments lasted for six weeks. Participants' postural stability, muscle strength and pain were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.After 3 weeks of intervention, Between-group comparisons showed that both the ST + PNF group and ST + PNF + TEAS group showed significantly greater performance than the ST group in the postural stability measure (P < 0.02) and pain score(P < 0.05). The peak torque of quadriceps extensors and flexors at the velocity of 60°/s was significantly higher in the ST + PNF + TEAS group than in the ST group (P < 0.02). After 6 weeks of intervention, only the ST + PNF + TEAS group was superior to the ST group in postural stability measure(P < 0.04) and in pain score (P < 0.05). The ST + PNF + TEAS group was significantly higher than the ST + PNF group and the ST group in the peak torque of quadriceps extensors at the velocity of 60°/s and 180°/s (P < 0.01).PNF training could improve dynamic postural stability and relieve pain at three weeks, while TEAS combined with PNF was more effective in relieving pain, strengthening muscle strength and improving dynamic postural stability at six weeks post-intervention.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study examined the relationships between the resting muscle shear modulus and dynamic performance during the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) and explosive exercises. To this end, we measured the jump height during three types of vertical jumps (squat jump [SJ], countermovement jump [CMJ], and rebound jump [RJ]) and the multi-joint leg extension power at three velocities (low, moderate, and high) of 30 healthy women. Using ultrasound elastography, the resting shear modulus of the vastus lateralis was assessed in the sitting position as an index of passive muscle mechanical properties. The results showed that the shear modulus was positively correlated with RJ height and multi-joint leg extension power at moderate and high velocities (r = 0.435-0.563, P < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the shear modulus and SJ height, CMJ height, and multi-joint leg extension power at low velocity. Contact time (i.e. the time under force exertion against the ground) during RJ (161 ± 19 ms) was 19% of that during CMJ (869 ± 171 ms). The results suggest that passive muscle mechanical properties play an important role in high-speed SSCs and dynamic explosive performance.HighlightsThe resting shear modulus was related to performance in stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) exercise involving a series of rapidly performed SSCs.The resting shear modulus was associated with muscular power in high-velocity conditions but not in low-velocity conditions.This study suggests that the passive mechanical properties of an agonist muscle play an important role in high-speed dynamic performance.",

          "abstract": "Unaccustomed or strenuous eccentric exercise is known to cause delayed-onset muscle soreness. A recent hypothesis postulated that mechano-energetic microinjury of the primary afferent sensory neuron terminals in the muscle spindles, namely a transient Piezo2 channelopathy, could be the critical cause of delayed-onset muscle soreness in the form of a bi-phasic non-contact injury mechanism. This theory includes that this microlesion could delay the medium-latency response of the stretch reflex. Our aim with this study was to investigate this hypothesis. According to our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of delayed-onset muscle soreness on the medium-latency response of the stretch reflex. Our findings demonstrated that a significant delay in the medium-latency stretch reflex could be observed right after a multi-stage fitness test in the quadriceps femoris muscles of Hungarian professional handball players who consequently experienced delayed-onset muscle soreness. The long-latency stretch reflex and most likely short-latency stretch reflex were unaffected by delayed-onset muscle soreness in our study, which is in line with earlier findings. We translate these findings as indicative of proprioceptive Type Ia terminal microdamage in the muscle spindle in line with the aforementioned new acute non-contact compression axonopathy theory of delayed-onset muscles soreness.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate deep tendon reflex responses and associated electrophysiological parameters of the muscles in patients with fibromyalgia. This cross-sectional study included 38 patients with fibromyalgia and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Deep tendon reflexes of the rectus femoris and triceps brachii were tested using a reflex hammer. Electromyographic (amplitude and duration of activation), inertial measurement unit (angular velocity, acceleration), and electromechanical (delay) analyses were performed using a surface electromyography (sEMG) device. Comparative analyses were carried out between patients and controls. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of hyperreflexia in distinguishing fibromyalgia patients from controls. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the right/left rectus femoris and/or triceps brachii were observed in more than 85% (ranging from 86.8 to 94.7%) of the fibromyalgia group. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly increased deep tendon reflex responses compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients revealed significantly higher amplitude, longer duration of muscle activation, greater sagittal acceleration and angular velocity, and shorter electromechanical delay. Normalized muscle activation (right and left rectus femoris and right triceps brachii) in response to deep tendon reflex test showed acceptable ability in differentiating fibromyalgia patients from controls (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.890, 0.784 and 0.782, respectively). For the right rectus femoris, values ≤ 28.3 (clinically corresponding to normoactive/hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) appeared to rule-out fibromyalgia with 94.1% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibit increased deep tendon reflex responses. Normal or decreased deep tendon reflex responses may probably be used as a rule-out criterion for fibromyalgia.© 2025.

          "abstract": "The effects of flywheel (FW) training on jump performance, muscle function, and muscle mass in athletes have not been fully clarified. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week FW training program on jump performance, stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function, muscle strength, peak power and muscle thickness in collegiate basketball players. Twenty male college basketball players (mean age: 19.8 ± 1.3 years, height: 179.1 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 72.9 ± 6.3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the FW training (n = 11) or control group (n = 9). The FW training group performed squat exercises, 5 sets of 8 repetitions, twice a week using the FW device. Baseline and post-training assessments of jump heights of squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and drop jumps (DJs) were performed in both groups. Additionally, the reactive strength index (RSI), representing SSC function; isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque during knee joint extension; peak power during squats; and quadriceps muscle thickness were evaluated. As the results, we observed that the FW training group demonstrated significant increases in post-training SJ height (15.1%, p = 0.03), DJ height (23.2%, p = 0.01), RSI (36.8%, p = 0.04), MVC, peak power and muscle thickness compared with pre-training levels. Furthermore, between-group comparisons indicated significantly higher post-training SJ height, DJ height, RSI, MVC, peak power, and muscle thickness in the FW training group (p < 0.05). Therefore, the FW training program effectively enhanced jump performance and SSC function in male basketball players and proved beneficial for muscle strength and hypertrophy.© 2025 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "The imbalance of muscle strength indicators has a negative impact on players. Lower limb muscle imbalance can cause gait abnormalities and increase the risk of muscle injury or decreased performance in significantly asymmetrical situations. This study aims to assess the lower limb muscle imbalance and gait feature between the dominant and non-dominant sides of badminton players and the associations between the two variables.The study included 15 badminton players with years of training experience. Muscle strength and gait parameters were obtained from isokinetic muscle strength testing and plantar pressure analysis systems. The symmetry index was calculated based on formulas such as plantar pressure distribution and percentage of plantar contact area.In the isokinetic muscle strength test, significant differences were found in bilateral knee flexors' average power and total work at 60°/s angular speed. The hamstring to quadriceps ratio (H/Q) range of knee joints of the dominant and non-dominant sides is 0.63-0.74 at low speed, while the H/Q range is 0.81-0.88 at fast speed. The H/Q of bilateral knees increases with increasing angular velocity. As the angular velocity increases, the peak torque to body weight ratio (PT/BW) of the participants' bilateral knee flexors and extensors shows a decreasing trend. The asymmetry score of H/Q at 180°/s angular speed is positively related with step time and stance time. There are varying degrees of differences in gait staging parameters, plantar pressure in each area, plantar contact area, and symmetry index between the dominant and non-dominant sides of badminton players when walking.Badminton players have weaker flexors of the knee joint, imbalanced muscle strength in flexors and extensors, decreased lower limb stability, and a risk of knee joint injury on the non-dominant side. The bending and stretching strength of the knee joint on the dominant side of the players is greater than that on the non-dominant side. The pressure in the first metatarsal region of the dominant side is higher, while that in the midfoot and heel regions is higher on the non-dominant side. badminton players have better forward foot force and heel cushioning ability. Long term badminton sports result in specialized changes in plantar pressure distribution and reduced symmetry.Copyright © 2024 Huang, Xu, Bai, Yu, Mei and Gu.",

          "abstract": "Montalvo, S, Gonzalez, MP, Dietze-Hermosa, MS, Martinez, A, Rodriguez, S, Gomez, M, Ibarra-Mejia, G, Tan, E, and Dorgo, S. Effects of different stretching modalities on the antagonist and agonist muscles on isokinetic strength and vertical jump performance in young men. J Strength Cond Res 39(2): 173-183, 2025-Exercise warm-up may include static or dynamic stretching, impacting performance differently. This study investigated the effects of various stretching protocols on isokinetic strength, muscular activity, and vertical jump performance. Sixteen subjects, divided evenly between trained and untrained groups, underwent 8 distinct stretching conditions in random order. Outcomes measured included isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque and power, muscular activity (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and biceps femoris), and jump performance (jump height and modified reactive strength index [RSImod]). Responses to the stretching conditions were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach. For isokinetic knee extension, dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist (DY-AG-ANT) and combined dynamic agonist with static antagonist stretching (DY-AG ST-ANT) produced significant improvements. Dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist increased peak torque by 12.72% and average torque by 30.80%, while DY-AG ST-ANT increased peak torque by 15.61% and average torque by 41.06%. Muscular activity also improved significantly; DY-AG ST-ANT increased EMG activity of the vastus lateralis by 29.43% and vastus medialis by 70.75%. Biceps femoris saw a 33.18% increase with DY-AG and a 22.15% increase with ST-AG. Countermovement jump height improved with DY-AG-ANT (12.6%) and static antagonist (ST-ANT) conditions (11.3%) ( p < 0.05).

When an appropriate SS duration (<60-seconds per muscle) is incorporated into a dynamic warm-up, performance decrements are often trivial. However, there is a lack of studies that observed the effects of extensive SS (180-seconds) 2-hours prior to a dynamic warm-up. The objective was to investigate ROM and performance effects of prolonged SS, 2-hours prior to a traditional warm-up. This study investigated 9 female and 8 male healthy recreationally active, young adult participants on the effects of prolonged SS (180-seconds per muscle) of the quadriceps and hamstrings, 2-hours before a traditional warm-up compared to an active control condition on hip flexion ROM, knee extension and flexion MVIC forces, CMJ, DJ, and quadriceps and hamstrings electromyography (EMG). There were no significant changes in knee flexion/extension MVIC forces, EMG, CMJ, or DJ height. However, there was significant, small magnitude (p = 0.002) greater post-warm-up left hip flexion ROM (115.4° ± 17.2) than pre-SS (108.9° ± 17.13, Effect size [ES]: 0.28) and control post-warm-up (p = 0.05, ES: 0.31, 109.5° ± 20.55). Similarly, right hip flexion ROM (117.2° ± 16.5) also demonstrated significant small magnitude (p = 0.003) greater than the pre-SS (112.4° ± 18.4, ES: 0.22) and control post-warm-up (p = 0.046, ES: 0.33, 110.8° ± 20.5). Additionally, significant, large magnitude greater hip flexion ROM was observed with the women vs. men (ES: 1.29 - 1.34).

          "title": "Fatiguing exercise reduces cellular passive Young's modulus in human vastus lateralis muscle.",
          "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrated that acute fatiguing exercise transiently reduces whole-muscle stiffness, which might contribute to increased risk of injury and impaired contractile performance. We sought to elucidate potential intracellular mechanisms underlying these reductions. To that end, the cellular passive Young's modulus was measured in muscle fibres from healthy, young males and females. Eight volunteers (four male and four female) completed unilateral, repeated maximal voluntary knee extensions until task failure, immediately followed by bilateral percutaneous needle muscle biopsy of the post-fatigued followed by the non-fatigued control vastus lateralis. Muscle samples were processed for mechanical assessment and separately for imaging and phosphoproteomics. Fibres were passively (pCa 8.0) stretched incrementally to 156% of initial sarcomere length to assess Young's modulus, calculated as the slope of the resulting stress-strain curve at short (sarcomere length = 2.4-3.0 µm) and long (sarcomere length = 3.2-3.8 µm) lengths. Titin phosphorylation was assessed by liquid chromatography followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The passive modulus was significantly reduced in post-fatigued versus control fibres from male, but not female, participants. Post-fatigued samples showed altered phosphorylation of five serine residues (four located within the elastic region of titin) but did not exhibit altered active tension or sarcomere ultrastructure. Collectively, these results suggest that acute fatigue is sufficient to alter phosphorylation of skeletal titin in multiple locations. We also found reductions in the passive modulus, consistent with prior reports in the literature investigating striated muscle stiffness. These results provide mechanistic insight contributing to the understanding of dynamic regulation of whole-muscle tissue mechanics in vivo. HIGHLIGHTS: What is the central question of this study? Previous studies have shown that skeletal muscle stiffness is reduced following a single bout of fatiguing exercise in whole muscle, but it is not known whether these changes manifest at the cellular level, and their potential mechanisms remain unexplored. What is the main finding and its importance? Fatiguing exercise reduces cellular stiffness in skeletal muscle from males but not females, suggesting that fatigue alters tissue compliance in a sex-dependent manner. The phosphorylation status of titin, a potential mediator of skeletal muscle cellular stiffness, is modified by fatiguing exercise. Previous studies have shown that passive skeletal muscle stiffness is reduced following a single bout of fatiguing exercise. Lower muscle passive stiffness following fatiguing exercise might increase risk for soft-tissue injury; however, the underlying mechanisms of this change are unclear. Our findings show that fatiguing exercise reduces the passive Young's modulus in skeletal muscle cells from males but not females, suggesting that intracellular proteins contribute to reduced muscle stiffness following repeated loading to task failure in a sex-dependent manner. The phosphorylation status of the intracellular protein titin is modified by fatiguing exercise in a way that might contribute to altered muscle stiffness after fatiguing exercise. These results provide important mechanistic insight that might help to explain why biological sex impacts the risk for soft-tissue injury with repeated or high-intensity mechanical loading in athletes and the risk of falls in older adults.© 2024 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "Muscle fascicles are shorter and stiffer than normal in spastic Cerebral Palsy (CP). Increasing fascicle length (FL) has been attempted in CP, the outcomes of which have been unsatisfactory. In healthy muscles, FL can be increased using eccentric exercise at high velocities (ECC). Three conditions are possibly met during such ECC: muscle micro-damage, positive fascicle strain, and momentary muscle deactivation during lengthening. Participants with and without CP underwent a single bout of passive stretching at (appropriately) high velocities using isokinetic dynamometry, during which we examined muscle and fascicle behaviour. Vastus lateralis (VL) FL change was measured using ultrasonography and showed positive fascicle strain. Measures of muscle creatine kinase were used to establish whether micro-damage occurred in response to stretching, but the results did not confirm damage in either group. Vastus medialis (VM) and biceps femoris muscle activity were measured using electromyography in those with CP. Results supported momentary spastic muscle deactivation during lengthening: all participants experienced at least one epoch (60 ms) of increased activation followed by activation inhibition/deactivation of the VM during knee flexion. We argue that high-velocity passive stretching in CP provides a movement context which mimics ECC and could be used to increase spastic FL with training.",

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities.

Determining changes in muscle size and architecture after exercise training: One site does not fit all. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 787-790, 2024-Different methods can be used to assess muscle hypertrophy, but the effects of training on regional changes in muscle size can be detected only using direct muscle measurements such as muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, or volume. Importantly, muscle size increases vary across regions within and between muscles after resistance training programs (i.e., heterogeneous, or nonuniform, muscle hypertrophy). Muscle architectural changes, including fascicle length and pennation angle, after resistance and stretch training programs are also region-specific. In this paper, we show that the literature indicates that a single-site measure of muscle shape does not properly capture the effects achieved after exercise training interventions and that conclusions concerning the magnitude of muscle adaptations can vary substantially depending on the muscle site to be examined. Thus, we propose that measurements of muscle size and architecture should be completed at multiple sites across regions between the agonist muscles within a muscle group and along the length of the muscles to provide an adequate picture of training effects.Copyright © 2023 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

          "abstract": "Knee extension contracture is a common postinjury and postsurgical complication, which decreases knee joint flexion. Many techniques have been described in the literature to restore knee flexion, with the most common one being an arthroscopic lysis of adhesions. However, in severe cases, additional intra- and extra-articular procedures are needed to restore full knee flexion. Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) is one of them. Unfortunately, it may lead to devastating complications, such as iatrogenic rupture of the patellar tendon or fractures of the patella or tibial tuberosity. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to present a safer modification of MUA for knee extension contracture in cases in which excessive force is demanded to achieve flexion.

In this work, we evaluated the effect of muscle passive stretch on shear wave propagation along and across the muscle fibers using a rotational 3D shear wave elasticity imaging system and automatic analysis methods. We imaged the vastus lateralis of 10 healthy volunteers, modulating passive stretch by imaging at 8 different knee flexion angles (controlled by a BioDex system). In addition to demonstrating the ability of this acquisition and automatic processing system to estimate muscle shear moduli over a range of values, we evaluated potential higher order biomarkers for muscle health that capture the change in muscle stiffness along and across the fibers with changing knee flexion. The median within-subject variability of these biomarkers is found to be <16%, suggesting promise as a repeatable clinical metric. Additionally, we report an unexpected observation: that shear wave signal amplitude along the fibers increases with increasing flexion and muscle stiffness, which is not predicted by transversely isotropic (TI) material simulations. This observation may point to an additional potential biomarker for muscle health or inform other material modeling choices for muscle.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "First described in 1875 by Wilhelm Heinrich Erb and Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal, the deep tendon reflex (DTR) is essential in examining and diagnosing neurologic disease. Deep tendon reflexes or, more accurately, the 'muscle stretch reflex' can aid in evaluating neurologic disease affecting afferent nerves, spinal cord synaptic connections, motor nerves, and descending motor pathways. Proper technique and interpretation of results are crucial in achieving a proper distinction between upper and lower motor neuron pathologic processes such as multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injuries, and spinal muscular atrophies, with the presence of hyporeflexia or hyperreflexia considered a 'hard sign' of neurologic dysfunction. There are five primary deep tendon reflexes: biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, patellar, and ankle. Biceps Reflex: Muscle involved: biceps brachii. Nerve supply: musculocutaneous. Segmental innervation: C5-C6. Brachioradialis Reflex: Muscle involved: brachioradialis. Nerve supply: radial. Segmental innervation: C5-C6. Triceps Reflex: Muscle involved: triceps brachii. Nerve supply: radial . Segmental innervation: C7-C8. Patellar Reflex (knee-jerk): Muscle involved: quadriceps femoris. Nerve supply: femoral. Segmental innervation: L2-L4. Achilles Reflex (ankle-jerk): Muscles involved: gastrocnemius, soleus. Nerve supply: tibial. Segmental innervation: S1-S2. To provide a standard scale for evaluating deep tendon reflexes, in 1993, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) proposed a grading scale from 0 to 4. This scale has been validated and is universally accepted. NINDS grading of deep tendon reflexes. 0: Reflex absent. 1: Reflex small, less than normal, includes a trace response or a response brought out only with reinforcement. 2: Reflex in the lower half of a normal range. 3: Reflex in the upper half of a normal range. 4: Reflex enhanced, more than normal, includes clonus if present, which optionally can be noted in an added verbal description of the reflex. In some instances, a plus sign (+) is written after the number. When discussing DTRs, adding or omitting a plus sign does not change the meaning of the reflex grade observed. What is 'normal' typically depends on the patient's history and past documented reflex grade. Abnormality is suggested when asymmetric reflexes are found. Once the examiner obtains a reflex on one side, they should test the same reflex on the opposite side for comparison.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

          "abstract": "Hyperreflexia is common after neurological injury such as stroke, yet clinical interventions have had mixed success. Our previous research has shown that hyperreflexia of the rectus femoris (RF) during pre-swing is closely associated with reduced swing phase knee flexion in those with post-stroke Stiff-Knee gait (SKG). Thus, reduction of RF hyperreflexia may improve walking function in those with post-stroke SKG. A non-pharmacological procedure for reducing hyperreflexia has emerged based on operant conditioning of H-reflex, an electrical analog of the spinal stretch reflex. It is currently unknown whether operant conditioning can be applied to the RF. This feasibility study trained 7 participants (5 neurologically intact, 2 post-stroke) to down-condition the RF H-reflex using visual feedback. We found an overall decrease in average RF H-reflex amplitude among all 7 participants (44% drop, p < 0.001, paired t-test), of which the post-stroke individuals contributed (49% drop). We observed a generalized training effect across quadriceps muscles. Post-stroke individuals exhibited improvements in peak knee-flexion velocity, reflex excitability during walking, and clinical measures of spasticity. These outcomes provide promising initial results that operant RF H-reflex conditioning is feasible, encouraging expansion to post-stroke individuals. This procedure could provide a targeted alternative in spasticity management.© 2023. The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "Wearable assistive technology for the lower extremities has shown great promise towards improving gait function in people with neuromuscular injuries. But common secondary impairments, such as hypersensitive stretch reflexes or hyperreflexia, have been often neglected. Incorporation of biomechanics into the control loop could improve individualization and avoid hyperreflexia. However, adding hyperreflexia prediction to the control loop would require expensive or complex measurement of muscle fiber characteristics. In this study, we explore a clinically accessible biomechanical predictor set that can accurately predict rectus femoris (RF) reaction after knee flexion assistance in pre-swing by a powered orthosis. We examined a total of 14 gait parameters based on gait kinematic, kinetic, and simulated muscle-tendon states from 8 post-stroke individuals with Stiff-Knee gait (SKG) wearing a knee exoskeleton robot. We independently performed both parametric and non-parametric variable selection approaches using machine learning regression techniques. Both models revealed the same four kinematic variables relevant to knee and hip joint motions were sufficient to effectively predict RF hyperreflexia. These results suggest that control of knee and hip kinematics may be a more practical method of incorporating quadriceps hyperreflexia into the exoskeleton control loop than the more complex acquisition of muscle fiber properties.© 2023.

          "abstract": "This retrospective (case-control) collaborative study evaluates tendon reflex recordings combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials recordings (T-MEPs) at lower limbs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).T-MEPs were recorded in 97 ALS patients distinguished according to their patellar reflex briskness. Patients' electrophysiological data were compared with values measured in 60 control patients matched for age and height. Correlations studies between parameters or with some patients' clinical characteristics were also performed.The central motor conduction time yields the highest sensitivity (82%) and specificity (93%), allowing twice more upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction detection than clinical examination, and being more altered in late stages of the disease. The T response to MEP response amplitude ratio (T/MEP ar) is nearly as sensitive to detect ALS and better identifies abnormal hyperreflexia. It is not correlated with evolutive stage, contrarily to conduction time-related parameters. In addition, T-MEPs detect asymmetries escaping clinical examination.The corticospinal conduction to lower limbs is slowed in ALS. The T/MEP ar helps deciding when patellar reflexes are abnormal in a given patient suspected of ALS.The T-MEP technique provide powerful electrophysiological biomarkers of UMN involvement in ALS. This simple and painless procedure introduces the clinically useful concept of electrophysiological hyperreflexia and might be expanded to future exploration of proximal upper limbs and bulbar territories.Copyright © 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

          "abstract": "The relationship between stiffness and drop jump performance in athletes in various stages of development has yet to be fully investigated. The first aim of this study was to investigate the association between the stiffness of the patellar and quadriceps tendon (PT, QT), gastrocnemius-Achilles tendon unit (GAT), and rectus femoris (RF) using drop jump (DJ) performance in young basketball players. The second aim was to investigate possible variations in the stiffness levels of those tissues in different developmental stages.The stiffness levels of the GAT, PT, QT, and RF were measured in both limbs in 73 male basketball players aged 12 to 18 years. The reactive strength index (RSI), contact time (CT) and jump height (JH) during 30 and 40 cm DJs were also measured.Pearson correlation coefficients showed a significant association between DJ performance and PT, QT, GAT, and RF dynamic stiffness. Moreover, the youngest subjects were found to have lower stiffness values than the older ones.Tissue stiffness can affect athletic performance by modifying the stretch-shortening cycle in young basketball players. Stiffness of muscles and tendons increases during the maturation process. Further investigations could shed light on the effect of training on the stiffness of muscles and tendons.",

Our aim was to ascertain whether the corrected position of the patella and improvement of the power of the quadriceps were maintained for 4 years or more. Twenty older children (mean age: 14.2 years) with long-standing crouch gait secondary to cerebral diplegia underwent surgery to correct crouch gait that included the patellar tendon shortening. The technique for plicating the tendon differed for skeletally mature and immature patients. The length of the patellar tendon was measured by the Koshino Index. The strength of the quadriceps muscle was assessed by manual muscle testing and with a dynamometer and extensor lag, if present, was measured with a goniometer. In all 40 knees, the patella was brought to a more distal position and the position was maintained for a mean duration of 84 months (Koshino Index: preoperative 1.3 ± 0.10; 3-month postoperative 0.95 ± 0.05; final follow-up 0.95 ± 0.04). The results were the same for the techniques used for skeletally mature and immature patients. The power of the quadriceps improved [Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 3 to MRC grade 4] and the improvement was maintained.

CASEs underwent corrective surgery for both the foot and knee deviations, inclusive of a QF aponeurectomy. Controls (CTRLs) underwent corrective surgery for foot deviations only. QF spasticity was assessed with the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) before and 1 month after surgery. The Wilcoxon test was used to assess MTS variations over time and the Mann-Whitney test was used to verify the presence of group differences at the 1 month mark.Ninety-three patients were included: 57 cases (30F, 1-34 years from lesion) and 36 controls (12F, 1-35 years from lesion). Before surgery, both CASEs and CTRLs had similar MTS scores (median MTS = 3) and functional characteristics. One month after surgery, QF spasticity was significantly lower in the CASEs compared to CTRLs (p = 0.033) due to a significant reduction of the median MTS score from 3 to 0 in the CASE group (p < 0.001) and no variations in the CTRL group (p = 0.468). About half of the cases attained clinically significant MTS reductions and complete symptom relief even many years from the stroke.Functional surgery inclusive of QF aponeurectomy can be effective in reducing or suppressing spasticity in chronic stroke patients.

The relationships between DOMS and muscle function and functional performance were also tested. Methods: Fifty-four participants were randomized into four groups. Eccentric exercise was used to induce DOMS. Each group received either no treatment, PBM, stretching or PBM combined with stretching at 24, 48, and 72 h postexercise. Pressure pain threshold (PPT), numerical rating scale (NRS), single-leg forward jump (SLFJ), and maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) were measured at baseline, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after eccentric exercise. Between-group differences were tested using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and the relationships between DOMS and MIVC, and SLFJ were examined using Pearson's correlation analysis. Results: The PPT at the vastus medialis and vastus lateral in the PBM combined with stretching group was significantly lower than that in control group at 72 h (p = 0.045) and 48 h (p = 0.037) postexercise. No significant between-group difference in PPT was found for the rest occasions. There was no significant between-group difference in NRS, MVIC, and SLFJ on any occasion (p ≥ 0.052).

Anthropometric measurements, assessment of physical performance, muscle strength (handgrip strength [HGS]), muscle mass (B-mode muscle ultrasonography), and muscle quality (identified via SWE) were performed for all patients.The median (interquartile range) age of participants was 69 (59-76) years and 62% (n = 80) were female.

The median average value of SWE measurement (Vmean ) of the rectus femoris (RF) in passive stretching was significantly lower in the low HGS group. In regression analyses, Vmean was significantly associated with HGS independently of age, sex, and body mass index. Optimal cutoff values of the Vmean value (m/s) of RF in passive stretching for predicting low HGS were ≤2.62 for male (area under the curve [AUC], 0.882; 95% CI, 0.705-0.938; P = <0.0001), and ≤2.52 for female (AUC, 0.719; 95% CI, 0.605-0.833; P = 0.002).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study revealing SWE is a good predictor of muscle strength, and it could be a useful tool for evaluating muscle quality in clinical practice.

          "abstract": "Faster walking speeds increase the demand on quadriceps muscles to produce adequate force to decelerate body mass and control knee flexion. Quadriceps fascicle behavior (i.e., fascicle length changes) influences force generation, which in turn affects mechanical loading of the articular cartilage during walking and the biochemical environment of the knee joint. The fascicle behavior underlying different walking speeds remains unclear but should be characterized to better understand how the quadriceps muscles accommodate faster walking speeds, speeds that often associate with better cartilage health outcomes. Our purpose was to quantify quadriceps muscle net fascicle length change during weight acceptance across a range of walking speeds in the context of more well-documented changes in muscle activity and knee joint moments. We hypothesized that vastus lateralis (VL) fascicles in healthy young adults would produce force with more overall lengthening in early stance at faster walking speeds with concomitant increases in muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengthening, internal peak knee extensor moment (pKEM), vertical ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activity. Participants walked for two-minute trials at their preferred speed and at 0.75 m/s and 1.75 m/s. We found that on average, the VL accommodates the greater mechanical demands of walking at faster speeds with greater muscle activity and while resisting muscle lengthening behavior. We infer then that tendon stretch accommodates MTU lengthening in healthy young adults across a range of speeds and suggest these results motivate additional studies aimed at evaluating VL fascicle behavior individuals with known quadriceps strength deficits, inhibition, or heightened risk for developing osteoarthritis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99). Lumbar extension accounted for nearly 70% of LBP incidences. Most players in the intervention group demonstrated improved physical function associated with the exercises.The semi-customized prevention program decreased the incidence of LBP and enhanced the physical function parameter in high school volleyball players.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

          "abstract": "A rowing cycle is characterised by a stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) at the quadriceps femoris muscle-tendon unit (MTU) level. However, due to the associated decoupling between MTU and muscle fascicle length changes, it remains unclear whether a rowing cycle causes active stretch at the muscle level. Fifteen young, sub-elite, male rowers (19.5 ± 1.6 yr; 1.94 ± 0.06 m; 91.9 ± 5.4 kg; rowing experience: 7.5 ± 2.8 yr) performed randomised 60-s rowing intervals using a traditional style at a low (LiR) and high intensity (HiR) and a micro-pause style at a low intensity (MpR). Muscle activity, knee joint angles, and muscle fascicle length changes from the left-sided vastus lateralis (VL) muscle were quantified using surface electromyography, inertial measurement units, and B-mode ultrasound imaging, respectively. All rowing conditions showed active fascicle stretch during late knee flexion (p≤0.001, standardised mean difference (SMD) ≥0.72) and subsequent active fascicle shortening throughout knee extension. Active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.49) were not significantly different (p≥0.174; SMD≤0.26) between LiR and MpR, but were significantly increased during HiR (p≤0.001; SMD≥0.70). The percentage of rowing cycles that involved active fascicle stretch (rANOVA: p≤0.001, ηp2 = 0.95; post-hoc: p≤0.001, SMD≥0.87) was also significantly higher for HiR (98.3 ±12.9%) compared with both LiR (65.0 ± 48.1%) and MpR (68.3 ± 46.9%). In conclusion, rowing involves SSC at the VL muscle fascicle level, but the amount of active stretch differs between rowing intensities, with the longest, largest, and fastest active stretch occurring during HiR. SSC-based mechanisms may therefore contribute more to rowing performance during HiR than LiR or MpR.HighlightsSurface electromyography and ultrasound imaging revealed stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) of the vastus lateralis muscle fascicles during rowingIncreased active fascicle stretch duration, amplitude and velocity from low- to high-intensity rowing indicate that SSC-based mechanisms likely contribute more to performance during high-intensity rowingThe SSC within the vastus lateralis muscle was independent of the rowing style at the same low rowing intensity.",

          "abstract": "To investigate the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) combined with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on postural stability, muscle strength and pain in patients with tibial plateau fracture.A 3-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 60 patients with tibial plateau fracture. Participants received one of the following interventions: standard treatment (ST group, n = 20), ST + PNF training (ST + PNF group, n = 20), ST + PNF training + TEAS intervention (ST + PNF + TEAS group, n = 20). All treatments lasted for six weeks. Participants' postural stability, muscle strength and pain were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.After 3 weeks of intervention, Between-group comparisons showed that both the ST + PNF group and ST + PNF + TEAS group showed significantly greater performance than the ST group in the postural stability measure (P < 0.02) and pain score(P < 0.05). The peak torque of quadriceps extensors and flexors at the velocity of 60°/s was significantly higher in the ST + PNF + TEAS group than in the ST group (P < 0.02). After 6 weeks of intervention, only the ST + PNF + TEAS group was superior to the ST group in postural stability measure(P < 0.04) and in pain score (P < 0.05). The ST + PNF + TEAS group was significantly higher than the ST + PNF group and the ST group in the peak torque of quadriceps extensors at the velocity of 60°/s and 180°/s (P < 0.01).PNF training could improve dynamic postural stability and relieve pain at three weeks, while TEAS combined with PNF was more effective in relieving pain, strengthening muscle strength and improving dynamic postural stability at six weeks post-intervention.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Unaccustomed or strenuous eccentric exercise is known to cause delayed-onset muscle soreness. A recent hypothesis postulated that mechano-energetic microinjury of the primary afferent sensory neuron terminals in the muscle spindles, namely a transient Piezo2 channelopathy, could be the critical cause of delayed-onset muscle soreness in the form of a bi-phasic non-contact injury mechanism. This theory includes that this microlesion could delay the medium-latency response of the stretch reflex. Our aim with this study was to investigate this hypothesis. According to our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of delayed-onset muscle soreness on the medium-latency response of the stretch reflex. Our findings demonstrated that a significant delay in the medium-latency stretch reflex could be observed right after a multi-stage fitness test in the quadriceps femoris muscles of Hungarian professional handball players who consequently experienced delayed-onset muscle soreness. The long-latency stretch reflex and most likely short-latency stretch reflex were unaffected by delayed-onset muscle soreness in our study, which is in line with earlier findings. We translate these findings as indicative of proprioceptive Type Ia terminal microdamage in the muscle spindle in line with the aforementioned new acute non-contact compression axonopathy theory of delayed-onset muscles soreness.",

Materials and Methods: Thirty sedentary patients were selected for the project (25 males and 5 females), with a mean age of 73 ± 5 years (range 44-94 years). Twenty-five were implanted with a Pacemaker (PM) and five with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD). Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter was present in ten (34%) patients, post-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in five (17.2%), sick sinus syndrome in six (20,7%), complete atrium-ventricular block in six (20.7%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in one (3.4%) and recurrent syncope in one (3.4%). The baseline assessment comprised cardiovascular examination, resting and stress ECG, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (V ̇O2peak), strength assessment of different muscle groups, and a flexibility test. The same measurements were repeated after 15-20 consecutive training sessions, over a 2-month period. The exercise prescription was set to 70-80% of HRR (Heart rate reserve) and to 50-70% of 1RM (1-repetition maximum, muscular force). The training protocol consisted of two training sessions per week performed in our institute, 90 min for each (warm-up, aerobic phase, strength phase and stretching) and one or more at home autonomously. Results: The cardiopulmonary testing after the training period documents a significant improvement in V ̇O2peak (15 ± 4 mL/kg/min vs. 17 ± 4; p = 0.001) and in work load (87 ± 30 watts vs. 108 ± 37; p = 0.001). Additionally, strength capacity significantly increased after the cardiac rehabilitation program, (quadriceps: 21 ± 18 kg vs. 29 ± 16 kg, p = 0.00003). Flexibility tests show a positive trend, but without statistical significance (sit-and-reach test: -19 ± 11 cm vs. -15 ± 11.7 cm; back-scratch test: -19 ± 11.6 cm vs. -15 ± 10 cm; lateral flexibility right -44 ± 1.4 cm vs. -43 ± 9.5 cm; left -43 ± 5 vs. -45 ± 8.7 cm).

Muscle forces were estimated in OpenSim when hamstring optimal lengths changed in the range of 70-130% of the control case in 5% increments. The force and accumulated force of quadriceps muscle were calculated to evaluate the impact of hamstring optimal lengths on the loading on tibial tuberosity. The changes in muscle forces throughout the gait cycle were compared by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The average peak force and accumulated force of five gait cycles were compared.Although the maximum force of the quadriceps muscle was slightly affected by changes in hamstring optimal lengths, the accumulated force of quadriceps muscle increased by 21.97% with hamstring optimal lengths decreased by 30% of the control case. The increase of the muscle force mainly occurred in the early stance phase and terminal swing phase (P < 0.05). However, when hamstring optimal lengths were longer than the control, it had a little effect on accumulated force of quadriceps muscle.The results of this study indicate that a shorter hamstring optimal length, which means lack of flexibility, can cause a high accumulated force on tibial tuberosity, thus increasing the risk of OSD.

          "abstract": "Little is known about how muscle length affects residual force enhancement (rFE) in humans. We therefore investigated rFE at short, long, and very long muscle lengths within the human quadriceps and patellar tendon (PT) using conventional dynamometry with motion capture (rFETQ) and a new, non-invasive shear-wave tensiometry technique (rFEWS). Eleven healthy male participants performed submaximal (50% max.) EMG-matched fixed-end reference and stretch-hold contractions across these muscle lengths while muscle fascicle length changes of the vastus lateralis (VL) were captured using B-mode ultrasound. We found significant rFETQ at long (7±5%) and very long (12±8%), but not short (2±5%) muscle lengths, whereas rFEWS was only significant at the very long (38±27%), but not short (8±12%) or long (6±10%) muscle lengths. We also found significant relationships between VL fascicle length and rFETQ (r=0.63, p=0.001) and rFEWS (r=0.52, p=0.017), but relationships were not significant between VL fascicle stretch amplitude and rFETQ (r=0.33, p=0.126) or rFEWS (r=0.29, p=0.201). Squared PT shear-wave-speed-angle relationships did not agree with estimated PT force-angle relationships, which indicates that estimating PT loads from shear-wave tensiometry might be inaccurate.

          "abstract": "Recent studies have observed that stretching applied to antagonist muscles can promote improvement in agonist muscle performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different numbers of interset proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching for the antagonists on the total number of repetitions completed for the agonists (quadriceps) in the leg extension exercise. Fourteen physically active individuals (age: 29.35 ± 10.5 years; body mass: 79.1 ± 11.34 kg; height: 170.4 ± 8.7 cm) participated in this study. The following experimental protocols were performed: 1) Traditional protocol (Traditional) - without previous stretching; 2) PNF with lesser duration (PNF1-3 sets of 20 secs.); 3) PNF with greater duration (PNF2-3 sets of 30 secs.). Within the experimental protocols (PNF1 and PNF2), stretching exercises for the antagonists were performed before and between the four sets of the unilateral leg extension exercise. All tests were performed on the dominant limb only. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the total number of repetitions for the PNF2 protocol versus the Traditional protocol (p = 0.026). However, there was no significant difference between the PNF1 protocol versus the Traditional protocol (p = 0.577). In conclusion, in the leg extension exercise, an extended duration of interset PNF stretching for the hamstrings, promoted greater contractile performance for the quadriceps as demonstrated by significantly greater total repetitions over four sets.",

Thirtheen healthy participants (both genders) proposed for a pre-post experimental design. RF, VM, and VL elasticity (strain ratio, SR) was evaluated bilaterally by ultrasound with quasi-static elastography. Higher SR values refer to more rigid tissues. A SS protocol of 3 series of 30 s was applied at right lower limb. The left lower limb was considered as control group. Also, photogrammetry evaluated the knee/hip ROM.For SR muscle comparisons, VM was lower (less stiff) than VL and RF at pre- and post-SS. For time comparisons, no differences were observed for SR and ROM at pre- and post-SS. However, the effect size of the quadriceps SR at SS lower limb was higher than control.Acute effects of SS did not change the quadriceps SR or knee/hip ROM in healthy and active subjects.

          "title": "Pes Anserine Bursitis",
          "abstract": "The term \"pes anserinus\" translates to “goose's foot” in Latin and refers to the conjoined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus as they insert on the anteromedial proximal tibia (see Image. Pes Anserinus Tendons). The pes anserine tendons, each innervated by a distinct nerve, create a structure about 5 cm distal to the medial knee joint line. As crucial knee flexors, these muscles also aid in tibial internal rotation and provide resistance against rotational and valgus stresses. Located underneath the conjoined tendons is the pes anserinus bursa (see Image. Medial View of the Knee). This synovial tissue-lined structure facilitates smooth movement between the conjoined tendons and tibia. The bursa occasionally cushions between the conjoined tendons and medial collateral ligament (MCL). Bursal inflammation and pain can occur following an injury due to increased synovial fluid production by the bursal cells. Adjacent to the pes anserinus bursa is the musculi sartorii bursa. This fibrous structure is situated between the sartorius tendon and the combined gracilis and semitendinosus tendons. The smaller musculi sartorii bursa may communicate with the pes anserine bursa, and both are commonly referred to collectively as the pes anserine bursa. These bursae do not typically communicate with the knee joint, highlighting their unique anatomical and functional significance in knee movement and pathology. Pes anserine bursitis involves the inflammation of the bursal sac beneath the pes anserinus. The condition predominantly affects women who are overweight and middle-aged. Pes anserinus bursitis is characterized by pain at the pes anserine insertion, typically triggered by activities such as stair climbing or rising from a seated position. Pes anserine bursitis is often associated with other knee disorders, especially osteoarthritis. The condition presents as non-traumatic, spontaneous inferomedial knee pain. Pes anserine bursitis is generally self-limiting, usually responding effectively to conservative treatment methods like exercise and stretching programs. The term \"pes anserine pain syndrome\" encompasses a broader spectrum of medial knee pain, potentially including conditions beyond bursal inflammation. Differentiating between pes anserine bursitis and tendinitis can be challenging, as both the tendons and bursa lie close to each other. However, management for both conditions is the same. Moschcowitz was the first to describe pes anserine bursitis in 1937 as a condition notable for knee pain, primarily in females, elicited by climbing stairs and rising from a seated position. Difficulty with knee flexion was also observed.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

          "abstract": "The precise description of the fascia vasto-adductoria (FVA) has become an issue of great surgical and clinical importance. Neurovascular entrapment within the adductor canal (AC) may simulate many clinical conditions for cases presented with medial knee or leg pain and ischemic manifestations of the leg. The aim of the present work is to describe the morphological features of the FVA and to elucidate its neurovascular relations. Forty thigh specimens, pertaining to 15 embalmed and five fresh adult human cadavers, were dissected in pursuit of this aim. The FVA was a continuous subsartorial fascia, roofing the whole length of AC and extended between two points lying at a mean distance of 25.6 and 7 cm proximal to the base of patella. It was subdivided into two parts; proximal thin quadrangular (proximal part of FVA) and distal thick pentagonal (vastoadductor membrane; VAM) and the subsartorial space was observed superficial to it. The mean length of its proximal and distal parts was 7.8 and 7.9 cm, respectively. The proximal part of FVA, while stretched across the vastus medialis (VM) and the adductor longus (AL) muscles, became attached to the wall of the femoral artery and overlaid the femoral vessels, the saphenous nerve (SN), and an arterial pedicle for VM muscle. It was constantly pierced by two arterial pedicles arising from the femoral artery to the sartorius muscle and occasionally (50%) by a communicating nerve branch arising from the SN to join the medial femoral cutaneous nerve. The VAM stretched across the VM muscle and both the AL and adductor magnus (AM) muscles and overlaid the SN, its subsartorial and lower medial femoral cutaneous branches, femoral vessels, 1-3 arterial pedicles for the sartorius and descending genicular vessels. The VAM originated from the tendinous fibres of the AM tendon and constantly spread anterolaterally. It was constantly pierced by 1-3 arterial pedicles to sartorius muscle and both the lower medial femoral cutaneous branch and the subsartorial branches of the SN. An arterial pedicle to the VM muscle and perforating veins between the superficial veins and the femoral vein proved to pierce it in 8/40 specimens. Entrapment of the SN at the distal narrow aperture of the AC, or one of its cutaneous branches at the piercing sites of the FVA, should be remembered when diagnosing cases presented with medial knee or leg pain. The attachment of the proximal part of the FVA to the wall of the femoral artery could add to the mechanism of its potential compression. True AC block should be done deep to the FVA to ensure effective SN analgesia. Its site is recommended to be at the distal one cm of the proximal part of the AC which is at a distance of 16-17 cm proximal to the base of patella. The VAM, being an anatomical connection between the VM and AM muscles, is theorized to increase the mechanical efficiency of the VM oblique muscle to maintain the knee extensor mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Spinal reflexes are modified by spinal cord injury (SCI) due the loss of excitatory inputs from supraspinal structures and changes within the spinal cord. The stretch reflex is one of the simplest pathways of the central nervous system and was used presently to evaluate how inputs from primary and secondary muscle spindles interact with spinal circuits before and after spinal transection (i.e., spinalization) in 12 adult decerebrate cats. Seven cats were spinalized and allowed to recover for 1 mo (i.e., chronic spinal state), whereas 5 cats were evaluated before (i.e., intact state) and after acute spinalization (i.e., acute spinal state). Stretch reflexes were evoked by stretching the left triceps surae (TS) muscles. The force evoked by TS muscles was recorded along with the activity of several hindlimb muscles. Stretch reflexes were abolished in the acute spinal state due to an inability to activate TS muscles, such as soleus (Sol) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG). In chronic spinal cats, reflex force had partly recovered but Sol and LG activity remained considerably depressed, despite the fact that injecting clonidine could recruit these muscles during locomotor-like activity. In contrast, other muscles not recruited in the intact state, most notably semitendinosus and sartorius, were strongly activated by stretching TS muscles in chronic spinal cats. Therefore, stretch reflex pathways from TS muscles to multiple hindlimb muscles undergo functional reorganization following spinalization, both acute and chronic. Altered activation patterns by stretch reflex pathways could explain some sensorimotor deficits observed during locomotion and postural corrections after SCI.",

          "abstract": "Locomotion and scratch are characterized by alternation of flexion and extension phases within one hindlimb, which are mediated by rhythm-generating circuitry within the spinal cord. By definition, the rhythm generator controls cycle period, phase durations, and phase transitions. The aim was to determine whether rhythm-generating mechanisms for locomotion and scratch are similar in adult decerebrate cats. The regulation of cycle period during fictive scratching was evaluated, as were the effects of specific sensory inputs on phase durations and transitions during spontaneous fictive locomotion and pinna-evoked fictive scratching. Results show that cycle period during fictive scratching varied predominantly with flexion phase duration, contrary to spontaneous fictive locomotion, where cycle period varied with extension phase duration. Ankle dorsiflexion greatly increased extension phase duration and cycle period during fictive locomotion but did not alter cycle period during scratching. Moreover, stimulating the plantaris (ankle extensor muscle) nerve during flexion reset the locomotor rhythm to extension but not the scratch rhythm. Stimulating the plantaris nerve during extension prolonged the extension phase and cycle period during fictive locomotion but not during fictive scratching. Stimulating the sartorius nerve (hip flexor muscle) during early flexion reduced the flexion phase and cycle period during fictive locomotion, but considerably prolonged the flexion phase and cycle period during fictive scratching. These data indicate that cycle period, phase durations, and phase transitions are not regulated similarly during fictive locomotion and scratching, with or without sensory inputs, providing evidence for specialized rhythm-generating mechanisms within the adult mammalian spinal cord.",

Branching patterns of the nerve were recorded and distances from the LFCN to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the anterior margin of the tensor fascia lata (TFL) were measured to clarify skin incision positioning during minimally invasive anterior approach for total hip replacement.The LFCN divided proximal to the inguinal ligament in 13 cases and distal to it in 21 cases. In the distal group the mean distance from the ASIS to the nerve division was 34.5 mm (10-72 mm). The gluteal branch crossed the anterior margin of the TFL 44.5 mm (24-92 mm) distally to the ASIS. In 18 cases the femoral branch did not cross the TFL and was located in the intermuscular space between TFL and sartorius. In the remaining 16 cases, this branch crossed the anterior margin of the TFL 46 mm (27-92 mm) distally to the ASIS. During minimally invasive anterior approach along the anterior border of the TFL, the LFCN was found to be potentially at risk between 27 and 92 mm below the ASIS. We used those informations to describe a map of \"danger zones\" for the LFCN or its two main branches.According to this study, numerous anatomical variations of the LFCN at the thigh should be considered when performing anterior approach to the hip joint. Different mechanisms of injury during surgery should be considered especially during minimally invasive total hip replacement, such as section of the gluteal or the femoral branch where it crosses the anterior margin of the TFL or stretching of the femoral branch due to retractors positioned into the intermuscular space between sartorius and TFL. According to the map of \"danger zones\" reported, the author policy consists of positioning the skin incision as lateral and distal to the ASIS as possible.",

Physical treatments, preventative therapies, and rehabilitation could have a large role to play in the management of nonsurgical CHD patients with the goal to create the best possible musculoskeletal environment for pain-free hip function and to delay or prevent the onset of degenerative joint disease. Osteoarthritic hip joints can benefit from early detection and subsequent treatment. Physical therapists have long utilized manual testing techniques and clinical reasoning to diagnose early-onset joint osteoarthritis and therapeutic treatments consisting of correcting muscle dysfunctions, relieving pain, joint mobilizations, and advisement on lifestyle modifications could be equally beneficial to the canine patient. As well, sacroiliac joint dysfunctions may also afflict the dog.

          "abstract": "Between various etiological factors of idiopathic scoliosis we also studied the biomechanical causes connected with the hip and pelvic regions. At all children with idiopathic scoliosis there is a real or functional abduction contracture of the right hip (sometimes plus flexions- and out-rotation contracture). The right hip abduction contracture is connected with \"syndrome of contractures\" at newborns and babies.629 children treated in University Pediatric Orthopaedic Department, Lublin/Poland were divided into two groups: *I group of development of scoliosis- 220 children aged from 4 to 10. Real abduction contracture of the right hip 4-6-8 degree, adduction of the left hip 35-40-45 degree. Rotation deformity, both scoliosis (Lumbar L and thoracic Th) at the same time. Progression. **II group of development of scoliosis - 409 children aged from 10-12 to 14. Adduction of the right hip 10-15 even 20 degrees, adduction of the left hip 35-40-45 degree. Lumbar left convex scoliosis, no rotation deformity or small, no thoracic scoliosis, or small, no progression or small. INFORMATION ABOUT \"SYNDROME OF CONTRACTURES\": Clinical symptoms of _syndrome of contractures\" were described exactly by Mau and others. At scoliotic patients we see in the region of right hip the following tissues contracted and shortened: *tractus iliotibialis, *fascia lata, * fascias of m.gluteus medius and minimus, *m. sartorius, *m. rectus, *capsules of right hip joint. CLINICAL RESEARCH: Since 1980s we added the tests for the adduction of both hips in straight position of the joint to the standard examination of scoliotic patient. Depending on the value of adduction movements of both hips we divided all patients into two above mentioned groups (I and II). EVALUATION OF PRESENT REHABILITATION TREATMENT IN OUR MATERIAL:Children were divided into three groups depending on range of scoliosis: A. Scoliosis L 5 degrees - 10 degrees, Th 5 degrees - 10 degrees. These children did not perform (wrong!) extension exercises 10% B. Scoliosis L 15 degrees - 25 degrees, Th 15 degrees - 25 degrees. These children performed (wrong!) extension exercises 30% C. Scoliosis L 25 degrees - 35 degrees or more, Th 25 degrees - 35 degrees or more. Older children. Extension (wrong!) exercises long time (1-2-3 years!) 60%1 . The so-called idiopathic scoliosis are connected with the right hip real or functional abduction contracture (sometimes plus flexion and out-rotation contracture). 2. There are two groups of development of idiopathic scoliosis. The first group - small children, early rotation deformity, both scoliosis (L and Th), progression. The second group is connected only with the habit of permanent standing \"at ease\" on the right leg. Older children. L scoliosis, sometimes Th scoliosis. 3. X-ray pictures of spine with pelvis are necessary for proper diagnosis.4. Abduction contracture of the right hip is connected with \"syndrome of contractures\" of new-borns and babies.5. We see necessity to introduce new stretching-flexion asymmetric exercises and a special sports program for the children endangered with scoliosis. 6. We proved that the \"new prophylactics\" through \"new clinical test\" and \"new rehabilitation treatment\" at school children (5-6-7-8 years old) gives positives results.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to confirm the relationship between isolated frog muscle tension and muscle hardness by conducting physiological evaluation in vivo. Two different mounting forms of the muscle were adopted. One form placed the gastrocnemius muscle (GA) on a base plate; this dented the muscle as a \"mass\". The other form tightened the sartorius muscle (SA) between holders in Ringer's solution; this bent the muscle as a \"string\". The first experimental method allowed testing of muscle hardness during stretching up to 140% (experiment 1) and the other method allowed testing of hardness during tetanic muscle contraction (experiment 2). The response force to vertical distortion, measured as muscle hardness, increased linearly with resting tension increase and this relationship was not influenced by the hysteresis (experiment 1). The response force increments at each level of tetanic muscle tension were proportional to the contracting tension (experiment 2). Although the muscle mounting forms were different, the response force increment to muscle tension in GA and SA showed quite similar relationships in both tests. It seems likely that muscle hardness evaluated by the response force must depend on the amplitude of the tension at the instant of the hardness measurement, regardless of the mounting form or the stretching phase (ascending or descending). In conclusion, muscle hardness measured by perpendicular distortion has physiological significance related to the changes in passive and active muscle tension.",

          "abstract": "Hypotonicity produces a marked activation of the Na+ pump in frog sartorius muscle. The increase in net Na+ efflux under hypotonic conditions occurs despite the reductions in [Na+]i that are due to fibre swelling and Na+ loss. The pump density (ouabain binding) increases not only upon reduction of the medium osmotic pressure (pi) from its normal value (pi = 1) to one-half (pi = 0.5), but also in muscles that are returned to pi = 1 after equilibration in pi = 2 medium. The equilibration in pi = 2 medium does not affect pump density. Ouabain-binding increments cannot be ascribed to a rise in the Na+-K+ exchange rate of a fixed number of pumps: they also occurred in the continued presence of a saturating concentration of ouabain (50 microM). Under those conditions, the pi = 1 pi = 0.5 transfer produced a 43 % increase in pump sites, while the pi = 2 pi = 1 transfer induced a rise of 46 %. Actinomycin D did not alter the stimulation of Na+ extrusion elicited by hypotonicity, suggesting that de novo synthesis of pumps was not involved in the increase of the apparent number of pump sites. Disruption of microtubules by colchicine (100 microM) and intermediate filaments by acrylamide (4 mM) did not alter the hypotonic effect. Likewise, genistein (100 microM), a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, did not affect significantly the hypotonic response. Microfilament-disrupting agents like cytochalasin B (5 microM) and latrunculin B (10 microM) reduced the increase in Na+ efflux induced by pi = 1 pi = 0.5 transfer by about 35 % and 72 %, respectively. Latrunculin B reduced the increases in pump density generated by pi = 1 pi = 0.5 and pi = 2 pi = 1 transfers by about 79 % and 91 %, respectively. The results suggest that the membrane stretch due to hypotonic fibre volume increase would promote a microfilament-mediated insertion of submembranous spare Na+ pumps in the sarcolemma and, consequently, the rise in active Na+ transport.",

To examine the molecular mechanisms that may influence the selection of these synaptic targets, we constructed single-cell cDNA libraries from sensory neurons that innervate antagonist muscles. Differential screening of these libraries identified a transcription regulatory co-factor of the LIM homeodomain proteins, the LIM domain only 4 protein Lmo4, expressed in most adductor but few sartorius sensory neurons. Differential patterns of Lmo4 expression were also seen in sensory neurons supplying three other muscles. A subset of motoneurons also expresses Lmo4 but the pattern of expression is not specific for motor pools. Differential expression of Lmo4 occurs early, as neurons develop their characteristic LIM homeodomain protein expression patterns. Moreover, ablation of limb buds does not block Lmo4 expression, suggesting that an intrinsic program controls the early differential expression of Lmo4. LIM homeodomain proteins are known to regulate several aspects of sensory and motor neuronal development. Our results suggest that Lmo4 may participate in this differentiation by regulating the transcriptional activity of LIM homeodomain proteins.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the influence of proprioceptive input from hip flexor muscles on the activity in hip flexors during the swing phase of walking in the decerebrate cat. One hindlimb was partially denervated to remove cutaneous input and afferent input from most other hindlimb muscles. Perturbations to hip movement were applied either by 1) manual resistance or assistance to swing or by 2) resistance to hip flexion using a device that blocked hip flexion but allowed leg extension. Electromyographic recordings were made from the iliopsoas (IP), sartorius, and medial gastrocnemius muscles. When the hip was manually assisted into flexion, there was a reduction in hip flexor burst activity. Conversely, when hip flexion was manually resisted or mechanically blocked during swing, the duration and amplitude of hip flexor activity was increased. We also found some specificity in the role of afferents from individual hip flexor muscles in the modulation of flexor burst activity. If the IP muscle was detached from its insertion, little change in the response to blocking flexion was observed. Specific activation of IP afferent fibers by stretching the muscle also did not greatly affect flexor activity. On the other hand, if conduction in the sartorius nerves was blocked, there was a diminished response to blocking hip flexion. The increase in duration of the flexor bursts still occurred, but this increase was consistently lower than that observed when the sartorius nerves were intact. From these results we propose that during swing, feedback from hip flexor muscle afferents, particularly those from the sartorius muscles, enhances flexor activity. In addition, if we delayed the onset of flexor activity in the contralateral hindlimb, blocking hip flexion often resulted in the prolongation of ipsilateral flexor activity for long periods of time, further revealing the reinforcing effects of flexor afferent feedback on flexor activity. This effect was not seen if conduction in the sartorius nerves was blocked. In conclusion, we have found that hip flexor activity during locomotion can be strongly modulated by modifying proprioceptive feedback from the hip flexor muscles.",

In the present study we have examined the temperature distribution of bullfrog sartorius muscle by the technique of infrared thermography, in which muscle temperatures at various regions can be measured and displayed as a thermogram on the monitor screen without thermal contact. It was found that in the muscle at rest and during an isometric tetanus, the temperature was not uniform, but differed from region to region. The amount of heat production during an isometric tetanus also differed from region to region, but the time course of heat production was nearly uniform in every region. By putting position markers on the muscle surface, it was possible to record muscle segment length changes together with temperature changes. It was found that during an isometric tetanus, the tibial region was stretched by the other regions, and the amount of heat produced was significantly greater in the other regions than in the tibial region. The application of infrared thermography in muscle energetics studies seems promising if the sensitivity of infrared detectors is improved.",

          "abstract": "Repeated contractions during which a muscle is stretched, known as eccentric contractions, have previously been shown to produce damage. This can be quantified by changes in various mechanical properties, of which reduction in tension and a shift in the optimum length for tension generation to longer lengths are examined here. The magnitude of these changes has been reported to depend strongly on the number of stretches, the amplitude of each stretch and the maximum tension reached. One proposed explanation of the changes predicts that muscle length should have a strong influence, but past reports have been contradictory on this point. Experiments were performed to test this hypothesis using whole toad sartorius muscles, which have the advantage of a relatively small passive tension, allowing a large range of lengths to be used. Initial length, amplitude of stretch and number of eccentric contractions were found by multiple linear regression to be the strong determinants of changes due to eccentric exercise. Velocity had a weak effect, and tension, varied only by varying the length of maximally activated muscles, was poorly correlated.",

          "abstract": "Following a series of eccentric contractions, that is stretching of the muscle while generating active tension, the length-tension relationship of isolated amphibian muscle has been shown to shift towards longer muscle length (Katz 1939; Wood et al. 1993). Here we report observations of electrically stimulated ankle extensor muscles of nine human subjects, demonstrating a similar shift in optimum angle for torque generation [3.9 (1.5) degrees] following exercise on an inclined treadmill that involved eccentric contractions in one leg. (All values are means with the SEMs in parentheses). The shift in the unexercised, control leg was significantly less [mean 0.4 (0.7) degree P < 0.05]. Correlated with this shift was a drop in torque [25.1 (5.6)% for the experimental leg; 1.6 (0.7)% for the control leg, P < 0.002]. Optimum angles returned to pre-exercise values by 2 days post-exercise, while torque took a week to recover. A similar shift in optimum length [12 (1.3)% of rest length] was obtained for five toad (Bufo marinus) sartorius muscles subjected to 25 eccentric contractions. Isometrically contracted control muscles showed a smaller shift [3.5 (1.6)%, n = 5]. Accompanying the shift was a drop in tension of 46 (3)% after the eccentric contractions [control isometric, 23 (6)%, P < 0.0001]. By 5 h after the eccentric contractions the shift had returned to control values, while tension had not recovered. When viewed with an electron microscope, sartorius muscles fixed immediately after the eccentric contractions exhibited many small, and a few larger, regions of myofilament disruption. In muscles fixed 5 h after the contractions, no small regions of disruption were visible, and the number of large regions was no greater than in those muscles fixed immediately after the eccentric contractions. These disruptions are interpreted as the cause of the shift in length-tension relationship.",

          "abstract": "1. It has been suggested that a group of interneurones located in the midlumbar segments of the spinal cord might play a role in switching from the stance to swing phases of the step cycle during locomotion. We have further examined the input to these neurones from proprioceptive afferents to test whether the connections to these cells are consistent with this role. 2. Electrical stimulation of group I and group II afferents in branches of the femoral nerve which supply iliopsoas, the major hip flexor muscle, excited a large majority of intermediate zone midlumbar interneurones which receive input from quadriceps group II afferents. The central latencies and properties of the EPSPs indicate that both group I and group II afferents from iliopsoas make monosynaptic connections with many midlumbar interneurones. 3. Group II afferents from both the ankle flexor tibialis anterior and the digit dorsiflexor extensor digitorum longus excited midlumbar interneurones. Similarly, they were also excited by group II afferents from both of the two main anatomical divisions of the sartorius muscle. 4. The frequent and potent excitation of midlumbar neurones from group I and II afferents in iliopsoas suggests that they may be excited at the end of the stance phase of the step when these muscles are stretched. This possibility is discussed in relation to recent work on the functional control of the step cycle.",

          "abstract": "The force-velocity property of passive muscle was investigated to determine if a discontinuity of slope occurred at zero velocity. Isolated, unstimulated whole frog sartorius muscles were subjected to constant-velocity stretches and releases using a servo-controlled lever. The force due to damping (delta T) was calculated by subtracting the tension measured at a very low speed (1.0 mm s-1) from the tension measured at the same length while the muscle was shortening or lengthening at a particular test speed. The experiments were performed over a range of speeds at each of several lengths and at two temperatures. For comparison, the same experiments were performed using a strip of pure latex rubber and a steel spring. Curves showing the magnitude of delta T vs velocity were nearly symmetric about the zero-velocity axis for the steel spring and the rubber strip, but were markedly asymmetric for passive muscle, showing a positive delta T for lengthening at all speeds that was between four and 11 times the negative delta T for shortening at the same speed, depending on the temperature and initial stretch length. The force due to damping at a given speed increased with extension above the rest length in passive muscle but decreased with increasing length in experiments using the latex strip. Predictions obtained from a mathematical model based on a damping element in series with a lightly damped spring were fitted to the experimental measurements of delta T vs velocity. The damping parameter provisionally representing interfilamentary sliding was between six and 12 times larger for lengthening than for shortening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Plotting the force and corresponding velocity data in this way produces a 'power-loop'. The 'power-loop' has less intuitive value than the frequently reported 'work-loops' but it is useful because it permits comparison with the force-velocity curve produced using traditional methods. The force/velocity combinations for oscillatory work during a contraction often exceed those that would be predicted from the force-velocity curve.

In control muscles, changes, if any, were significantly less. In electron micrographs, muscle fibers that had been subjected to a series of eccentric contractions showed sarcomeres with A bands displaced toward one half-sarcomere, leaving no overlap in the other half.

For sarcomere lengths of 2.7 microns and below the X-ray diffraction diagrams of each muscle type are very similar; the only differences being that the diffraction diagram for semitendinosus muscles exhibit the presence of a broad diffraction band or a cluster of diffraction orders at a spacing of ca. 230.0 nm and, also, they lack a periodicity of ca. 102.0 nm. For sarcomere lengths greater than 2.7 microns disruption of the sarcomere from sartorius muscle occurs as seen by the loss of sampling in the diffraction diagram. The semitendinosus muscle can be stretched to much longer lengths (in excess of 3.0 microns) before a loss of sampling is detected. The data also shows that in the case of the semitendinosus muscle for long sarcomere lengths transverse bands of mass are able to move without retaining a defined distance to either the Z or the M lines. This is not observed in the case of the sartorius muscle. Thus, at resolutions between ca. 3.6 microns and 7.50 nm significant ultrastructural differences between these two muscles are apparent. The data suggest that the ability of these mass bands to move may be responsible for the differences in the development of passive tension exhibited by these two muscles.",

Both isometric tetanic force and work per cycle were measured before, during, and after a 3-min fatigue. Both isometric tetanic force and positive work, the work done by the muscle during the shortening part of the cycle, rapidly decreased in parallel in the first 40 s of fatigue. Thereafter, force continued to decrease, but at a slower rate, to about 10% of prefatigue values, whereas positive work levelled off at about 30% of prefatigue values. Negative work, the work done on the muscle during the lengthening part of the cycle, increased during fatigue to the extent that net work became negative. This was due to a prolonged relaxation, which resulted in active force still being generated while the muscle was being stretched. Work and force recovered at about the same rate.

          "abstract": "1. Sartorius muscles of Rana temporaria, equilibrated at 20 degrees C in Ringer solution buffered with phosphates, were stimulated isometrically for 0.2 up to 0.75 s at lengths varying from 1.03 to 1.48 times rest length, L0. The aerobic recovery heat was measured for 10.5 min after contraction. 2. The recovery heat production had a complex time course, showing a variable delay to maximum, declining thereafter. In most cases, the rate of heat production did not decrease monotonically; attention was focused on the slow exponential decay which only persisted from 1.5-5 min after contraction. This latter part of the time course was considered as strictly aerobic and characterized by the time constant tau s. 3. Increasing the tetanus duration from 0.2 to 0.75 s increased initial heat Qi and recovery heat Qr in proportion, so that the recovery ratio R (Qr/Qi) did not change; it was equal to 1.29 +/- 0.03 (S.E.M.; n = 44) for muscles at about L0. The kinetics of heat production were modified with longer tetani; in particular, tau s was increased from 2.2 to 5.2 min. 4. When muscles were stretched beyond L0, as long as there was no increase of the resting heat rate (stretch response or 'Feng effect'), recovery heat production had a similar evolution to that in muscles at about L0; R was constant and equal to 1.21 +/- 0.03 (n = 46). 5. When muscles were sufficiently stretched to develop a stretch response, R increased proportionally to the stretch response. The effect seemed independent of the contractile machinery, as it vanished concomitantly with the stretch response, while force and Qi remained unchanged for the length considered. The kinetics were also modified--the delay to maximum was no longer detected and tau s most likely increased. 6. Substitution of 60% of the NaCl of the Ringer solution by NaI (mol/mol) produced a significant increase of R, mainly due to the increase of Qr. 7. The results show that neither the time course nor the amount of aerobic recovery heat Qr are strictly determined by the amount of initial heat Qi. The hypothesis is discussed that Qr might include a variable fraction due to processes which are not directly implicated in the actin-myosin interactions, possibly those involving the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the rate of resting metabolism.",

This force puts the series elastic component (SEC) under tension and in a domain which is not well defined in terms of tension-extension curve. In the present work, an attempt was made to determine the stiffness of the SEC for tensions greater than Po, using the sartorius muscle of the frog. For this purpose, rapid releases and stretches of different amplitudes were given during maximal isometric contractions. Plotting normalized tension (P/Po) against normalized length changes (negative or positive extensions, delta L/Lo.10(2] produced a tension-extension curve. The slopes of the linear part of each relationship on both sides of Po indicated an increase in SEC stiffness when the muscle was rapidly stretched. Furthermore, the transient character of the increase in stiffness was studied by measuring SEC stiffness during rapid releases applied at various time intervals after stretches: the muscle was found to be stiffer as the time interval was shorter. The results are discussed in terms of (i) non-linear behaviour of the passive and active parts of the SEC, (ii) enhancement of storage and release of potential energy.",

In the absence of serum and insulin, muscles maintained at approximately 93% of resting length atrophied with significant decreases in dry weight, protein content, and contractile force, and in the levels of activity of citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. Inclusion of 1.0 mU/ml of insulin in the culture medium prevented the decreases in muscle mass, twitch tension, and citrate synthase activity and minimized the decreases in lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and tetanic tension. Inclusion of 10% serum, in addition to 1 mU/ml insulin, in the medium did not have clear cut additional benefits. Stretching muscles to 110% of resting length (L0) resulted in marked deterioration with decreases in total protein, enzyme levels, and contractile force. Keeping muscles at approximately 93% L0 was as effective as maintenance at L0 in preventing atrophy and loss of contractile force and enzyme activities. This organ culture procedure, which maintains frog sartorius muscle in good condition without serum for at least 5 days, may provide a useful model for studying the regulatory mechanisms responsible for a variety of adaptations in muscle.",

Two procedures were followed. In the first, the muscles were lengthened in the relaxed state and stimulated isometrically just before and during the first part of shortening. The peak efficiency (positive work done divided by the energetic equivalent of the oxygen consumed) was approximately 25% at 0.75-1.5 muscle lengths/s (Lo/s) in sartorius, 19% at 1.0 Lo/s in EDL, and 15% at 0.5 Lo/s in the soleus. In contrast to the measured efficiency values, the ratio between the tension-time integral and the oxygen consumption (the economy) is greater in soleus than in EDL. In the second procedure, stimulation began before stretching and continued during the first part of shortening. In this case, the efficiency attained values of approximately 35% in sartorius, 50% in EDL, and 40% in soleus. These values are in rough agreement with those measured in vivo during running.",

          "abstract": "Small length changes were imposed on pairs of sartorius muscles from Rana temporaria and Rana pipiens in rigor and the mechanical and thermal responses studied. Rigor was induced by soaking the muscles overnight at 0 degrees C in a physiological salt solution containing 1.5 mM sodium azide and 0.4 mM sodium iodoacetate. Tension was measured at both the tibial and the pelvic ends of the preparation. Muscles were held at a steady tension of 20 to 76 kN m-2 and stretches or releases of 0.02 to 0.6 mm applied in pairs, with the initial change reversed several hundred milliseconds later. Single stretches resulted in heat absorption and releases in heat production by the preparation. Net heat production resulted from complete cycles of length changes larger than 0.1 mm, whether the initial change was a stretch or a release. The heat produced by the complete cycle was attributed to the movement of the muscles over the thermopile. It was proportional to the difference in tension between the tibial and pelvic ends of the preparation and increased with the size and speed of the length change. Half the heat produced by a complete cycle of length changes was subtracted from the thermal response recorded in the first half-cycle to obtain the reversible component of the response. The reversible component was linearly related to the tension change for all sizes and speeds of length change which were studied, with the heat:tension ratio ranging from -0.0093 to -0.0179 in eleven muscles (mean -0.0128 +/- 0.0009). The constancy of the heat:tension ratio in rigor muscles over a wide range of mechanical conditions indicates that the source of the thermal changes is the normal elasticity of the preparation. Since the size of the ratio is approximately the same as that measured in active muscles, the tension-dependent component of the thermal response to length changes applied to active muscles is probably also of elastic origin.",

No significant changes in the intensity ratio of two equatorial reflections (I1,0/I1,1) were observed when isometrically contracting muscles were slowly stretched by 5-6%, in spite of marked force changes. The intensity ratio also showed no significant changes when the load on isometrically contracting muscles was suddenly increased from Po to 1.2-1.5 Po to produce isotonic muscle lengthening. Closer examination of the data indicated that a small decrease in the value of I1,1 was caused by both slow stretch and isotonic lengthening. Because of the scatter of experimental plots in I1,0, the effect of small change in I1,1 on the intensity ratio fell within the range of accuracy of measurement. It is suggested that no marked changes in myosin head orientation or in the number of the cross-bridges in the vicinity of the thin filaments take place in response to slow stretches or isotonic lengthening, and that the decreased regularity of the filament lattice may produce the change in I1,1.",

(1974, Biophys. J. 14, 546-562). An implicit method was used for the numerical approximation in the simulations. The simulated force transients due to constant velocity length changes are found to be in qualitative agreement with re-investigated experimental results obtained from the whole sartorius muscle of the frog. A non-linear tension transient is observed, dependent both on amplitude and on velocity of release revealing an inflexion which gives the transient a shoulder shape. When velocity is increased the inflexion occurs earlier and at a lower tension value. A non-linear transient is observed during stretches performed at moderate velocities. Force responses are found to deviate concavely downwards from a linear time course. Simulations, however, predict a rather linear tension transient for comparable velocities. Implications of the experimental findings are discussed for both models.",

During ramp shortening, stiffness was determined from the slope of the tension-length diagram obtained during superimposed quick stretches. Both force and stiffness decreased, as the ramp shortening proceeded and approached a steady value after about 60 ms.

Golgi tendon organs generate activity consistent with sensitivity to active muscle tension. Muscle spindle afferents do not appear to conform to any single functional pattern for all muscles.

          "abstract": "The precise description of the fascia vasto-adductoria (FVA) has become an issue of great surgical and clinical importance. Neurovascular entrapment within the adductor canal (AC) may simulate many clinical conditions for cases presented with medial knee or leg pain and ischemic manifestations of the leg. The aim of the present work is to describe the morphological features of the FVA and to elucidate its neurovascular relations. Forty thigh specimens, pertaining to 15 embalmed and five fresh adult human cadavers, were dissected in pursuit of this aim. The FVA was a continuous subsartorial fascia, roofing the whole length of AC and extended between two points lying at a mean distance of 25.6 and 7 cm proximal to the base of patella. It was subdivided into two parts; proximal thin quadrangular (proximal part of FVA) and distal thick pentagonal (vastoadductor membrane; VAM) and the subsartorial space was observed superficial to it. The mean length of its proximal and distal parts was 7.8 and 7.9 cm, respectively. The proximal part of FVA, while stretched across the vastus medialis (VM) and the adductor longus (AL) muscles, became attached to the wall of the femoral artery and overlaid the femoral vessels, the saphenous nerve (SN), and an arterial pedicle for VM muscle. It was constantly pierced by two arterial pedicles arising from the femoral artery to the sartorius muscle and occasionally (50%) by a communicating nerve branch arising from the SN to join the medial femoral cutaneous nerve. The VAM stretched across the VM muscle and both the AL and adductor magnus (AM) muscles and overlaid the SN, its subsartorial and lower medial femoral cutaneous branches, femoral vessels, 1-3 arterial pedicles for the sartorius and descending genicular vessels. The VAM originated from the tendinous fibres of the AM tendon and constantly spread anterolaterally. It was constantly pierced by 1-3 arterial pedicles to sartorius muscle and both the lower medial femoral cutaneous branch and the subsartorial branches of the SN. An arterial pedicle to the VM muscle and perforating veins between the superficial veins and the femoral vein proved to pierce it in 8/40 specimens. Entrapment of the SN at the distal narrow aperture of the AC, or one of its cutaneous branches at the piercing sites of the FVA, should be remembered when diagnosing cases presented with medial knee or leg pain. The attachment of the proximal part of the FVA to the wall of the femoral artery could add to the mechanism of its potential compression. True AC block should be done deep to the FVA to ensure effective SN analgesia. Its site is recommended to be at the distal one cm of the proximal part of the AC which is at a distance of 16-17 cm proximal to the base of patella. The VAM, being an anatomical connection between the VM and AM muscles, is theorized to increase the mechanical efficiency of the VM oblique muscle to maintain the knee extensor mechanism.",

The aim of this anatomical study was to describe the different presentation features of the LFCN at the thigh and particularly to determine the potential location of damage during minimally invasive anterior approach for total hip replacement.The LFCN was dissected bilaterally at the thigh under the inguinal ligament in 17 formalin-preserved cadavers. Branching patterns of the nerve were recorded and distances from the LFCN to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the anterior margin of the tensor fascia lata (TFL) were measured to clarify skin incision positioning during minimally invasive anterior approach for total hip replacement.The LFCN divided proximal to the inguinal ligament in 13 cases and distal to it in 21 cases. In the distal group the mean distance from the ASIS to the nerve division was 34.5 mm (10-72 mm). The gluteal branch crossed the anterior margin of the TFL 44.5 mm (24-92 mm) distally to the ASIS. In 18 cases the femoral branch did not cross the TFL and was located in the intermuscular space between TFL and sartorius. In the remaining 16 cases, this branch crossed the anterior margin of the TFL 46 mm (27-92 mm) distally to the ASIS. During minimally invasive anterior approach along the anterior border of the TFL, the LFCN was found to be potentially at risk between 27 and 92 mm below the ASIS. We used those informations to describe a map of \"danger zones\" for the LFCN or its two main branches.According to this study, numerous anatomical variations of the LFCN at the thigh should be considered when performing anterior approach to the hip joint. Different mechanisms of injury during surgery should be considered especially during minimally invasive total hip replacement, such as section of the gluteal or the femoral branch where it crosses the anterior margin of the TFL or stretching of the femoral branch due to retractors positioned into the intermuscular space between sartorius and TFL.

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate deep tendon reflex responses and associated electrophysiological parameters of the muscles in patients with fibromyalgia. This cross-sectional study included 38 patients with fibromyalgia and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Deep tendon reflexes of the rectus femoris and triceps brachii were tested using a reflex hammer. Electromyographic (amplitude and duration of activation), inertial measurement unit (angular velocity, acceleration), and electromechanical (delay) analyses were performed using a surface electromyography (sEMG) device. Comparative analyses were carried out between patients and controls. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of hyperreflexia in distinguishing fibromyalgia patients from controls. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the right/left rectus femoris and/or triceps brachii were observed in more than 85% (ranging from 86.8 to 94.7%) of the fibromyalgia group. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly increased deep tendon reflex responses compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients revealed significantly higher amplitude, longer duration of muscle activation, greater sagittal acceleration and angular velocity, and shorter electromechanical delay. Normalized muscle activation (right and left rectus femoris and right triceps brachii) in response to deep tendon reflex test showed acceptable ability in differentiating fibromyalgia patients from controls (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.890, 0.784 and 0.782, respectively). For the right rectus femoris, values ≤ 28.3 (clinically corresponding to normoactive/hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) appeared to rule-out fibromyalgia with 94.1% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibit increased deep tendon reflex responses. Normal or decreased deep tendon reflex responses may probably be used as a rule-out criterion for fibromyalgia.© 2025.

The past several decades have seen a rise in research aimed at the anatomy and physiology of primate chewing muscles to better understand the functional and evolutionary significance of the primate masticatory apparatus. This review summarizes variation in jaw-adductor fiber types and muscle architecture in primates, focusing on physiological, architectural, and behavioral performance variables such as specific tension, fatigue resistance, muscle and bite force, and muscle stretch and gape. Paranthropus and Australopithecus are used as one paleontological example to showcase the importance of these data for addressing paleobiological questions.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of lengthened partial repetitions (LPs) vs. full range of motion (ROM) resistance training (RT) on muscular adaptations.In this within-participant study, thirty healthy, resistance-trained participants had their upper extremities randomly assigned to either a lengthened partial or full ROM condition; all other training variables were equivalent between limbs. The RT intervention was an 8-week program targeting upper-body musculature. Training consisted of two training sessions per week, with four exercises per session and four sets per exercise. Muscle hypertrophy of the elbow flexors and elbow extensors was evaluated using B-mode ultrasonography at 45% and 55% of humeral length. Muscle strength-endurance was assessed using a 10-repetition-maximum test on the lat pulldown exercise, both with a partial and full ROM. Data analysis employed a Bayesian framework with inferences made from posterior distributions and the strength of evidence for the existence of a difference through Bayes factors.Both muscle thickness and unilateral lat pulldown 10-repetition-maximum improvements were similar between the two conditions. Results were consistent across outcomes with point estimates close to zero, and Bayes factors (0.16 to 0.3) generally providing \"moderate\" support for the null hypothesis of equal improvement across interventions.Trainees seeking to maximize muscle size should likely emphasize the stretched position, either by using a full ROM or LPs during upper-body resistance training.

Therefore, our objectives were to estimate the effect of neurodynamic techniques on HF and to compare the effect of these techniques with static stretching.We systematically searched the Cochrane, MEDLINE(via PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science and Sportdiscus databases for RCTs comparing neurodynamic interventions with control intervention or with static stretching exercises for HF in adults with limited HF. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup analyses according to the type of comparison group(control group or static stretching exercises) and total number of sessions. Furthermore, to reflect the variation in genuine therapy effects in different scenarios, including future patients, we calculated a 95% prediction interval(prI).Thirteen trials were included, involving 624 participants. Pooled results showed a significant improvement in HF for immediate (SMD = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.44 to 1.59) and short-term effects (SMD = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.52). Subgroup analyses by type of comparison group showed that these techniques are more effective than the control group in the immediate and short term and than static stretching in the short term.

Three hamstring constituents were measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography. Skeletal muscle transcriptomes were compared across the genotypes of GWAS-identified variants in 48 healthy Japanese individuals. Association between GWAS-identified variants and history of muscle strain injury were examined in 1,428 Japanese athletes.Two loci on chromosome 11 demonstrated a genome-wide significant association with passive muscle stiffness of the biceps femoris long head (rs12807854 T/C: P = 5.19 × 10-10, rs78405694 T/C: P = 2.09 × 10-8; linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and stretching exercise habits). Skeletal muscle RNA sequencing revealed significantly elevated expression of extracellular matrix-related genes in muscles carrying stiffness-increasing alleles of these variants. Among athletes, rs12807854 T/C was significantly associated with a history of muscle strain injury (P = 0.0254; logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, competitive level, and main sport). Carriers of the C allele, associated with increased muscle stiffness, exhibited a heightened risk of muscle strain injury (odds ratio: 1.62; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.47 per C allele increase). In contrast, rs78405694 did not show a significant association with muscle strain injury in this population.A novel locus associated with passive muscle stiffness and muscle strain injury was identified.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week FW training program on jump performance, stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function, muscle strength, peak power and muscle thickness in collegiate basketball players. Twenty male college basketball players (mean age: 19.8 ± 1.3 years, height: 179.1 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 72.9 ± 6.3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the FW training (n = 11) or control group (n = 9). The FW training group performed squat exercises, 5 sets of 8 repetitions, twice a week using the FW device. Baseline and post-training assessments of jump heights of squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and drop jumps (DJs) were performed in both groups. Additionally, the reactive strength index (RSI), representing SSC function; isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque during knee joint extension; peak power during squats; and quadriceps muscle thickness were evaluated. As the results, we observed that the FW training group demonstrated significant increases in post-training SJ height (15.1%, p = 0.03), DJ height (23.2%, p = 0.01), RSI (36.8%, p = 0.04), MVC, peak power and muscle thickness compared with pre-training levels. Furthermore, between-group comparisons indicated significantly higher post-training SJ height, DJ height, RSI, MVC, peak power, and muscle thickness in the FW training group (p < 0.05).

All patients underwent a thorough clinical examination and imaging of extraocular muscle insertions on the Swept Source Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography. The accuracy of measuring muscle insertions with the ASOCT was compared with intraoperative caliper readings.Forty-seven muscles (28 patients) were imaged on ASOCT with confirmation intraoperatively during re-operation. The mean age of the patients was 21.6 ± 5.6 years. After looking at the imaging findings, the decision of which muscle to operate on changed in eleven patients (39.2%). The accuracy of ASOCT to measure muscle insertion ± 1 mm was seen in 78.7% (38/47 muscles).

          "abstract": "The rapid development of wearable technology, flexible electronics, and human-machine interaction has brought about revolutionary changes to the fields of motion analysis and physiological monitoring. Sensors for detecting human motion and physiological signals have become a hot topic of current research. Inspired by the muscle fiber structure, this paper proposed a highly stable strain sensor that was composed of stretchable Spandex fibers (SPF), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and silicone rubber (Ecoflex). This sensor adopted an immersion coating process in which MWCNTs were conformally deposited on SPF, and Ecoflex was filled into the fiber interstices, completing the encapsulation and filling of the SPF to construct a stable three-dimensional conductive network. Thanks to the filling of Ecoflex, contact between conductive fibers during the stretching process was avoided, resulting in a significant change in the resistance. The sensitivity of the sensor reached 54.84, which is 10 times higher than before the Ecoflex filling with a stretchable strain range of up to 70%. The encapsulation of Ecoflex also prevented the detachment of MWCNTs on the fibers during stretching, improving the mechanical stability. The sensor can be easily attached to the surface of human skin to rapidly monitor various human motion signals. Furthermore, the sensor was related to the manipulator through wireless Bluetooth to realize the intelligent control of the manipulator. This work not only provided a more precise data monitoring method for medical and motion analysis fields but also offered an innovative solution for manipulator control.",

However, evidence is limited with regards to which assessments and metrics may be most sensitive toward changes in training volume and intensity. The aim of this study was to investigate how a reduction in training volume, paralleled with an increase in training intensity, affects neuromuscular performance as measured through a countermovement jump (CMJ) and 10-5 hop test over a preseason period in female collegiate basketball players. Over a 3-week baseline period, athletes completed CMJ and 10-5 hop tests to quantify baseline performance. Measures of neuromuscular response to the changes in training volume and intensity were performed 2 and 4 days into the intervention week, as well as post 72 hours, post 7 days, and post 10 days. External workload data and descriptive analyses of resistance training stimuli suggest that during the intervention week, athletes experienced significantly lower training volumes and increases in training intensity. In response to these changes in training stimulus, athletes showed depressed performance acutely in metrics derived from both the CMJ and 10-5 hop test. Authors also observed a supercompensation effect at post 72 h, post one week, and post 2 weeks for metrics related to lower-limb stiffness and braking rate of force development. These findings highlight that in response to a high-intensity, low-volume training phase, female basketball players experienced alterations in lower-limb function, reflected in both decreases and increases in SSC performance.Copyright © 2024 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",

          "abstract": "Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2 (TRPV2) functions as a stretch-sensitive calcium channel, with overexpression in the sarcolemma of skeletal and cardiac myocytes leading to detrimental calcium influx and triggering muscle degeneration. In our previous pilot study, we showed that tranilast, a TRPV2 inhibitor, reduced brain natriuretic peptide levels in two patients with muscular dystrophy and advanced heart failure. Building on this, we performed a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study herein to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tranilast in the treatment of advanced heart failure in patients with muscular dystrophy.This study involved 18 patients with muscular dystrophy who had brain natriuretic peptide levels > 100 pg/mL, despite receiving standard cardioprotective therapy. Tranilast was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg three times daily. Over the short-term period (28 weeks), the primary endpoint of change ratio in the logarithm of brain natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 28 weeks was not significant in the full analysis set but was lower in the per set protocol compared with data from a previous beta-blocker treatment study. All 15 patients who completed the short-term treatment consented to be enrolled in long-term therapy for an additional 116 weeks. After all participants completed the long-term treatment, we analyzed all data. TRPV2 expression on the peripheral blood mononuclear cell surfaces decreased throughout the study period, confirming that the TRPV2 inhibitory effect of tranilast was maintained over time. Despite the presence of progressive disease, cardiac indices such as brain natriuretic peptide level, human atrial natriuretic peptide level, and fractional shortening, remained stable, and only brain natriuretic peptide levels at 144 weeks showed significant changes. The survival rate was 80.7%, and no cardiac deaths were reported. Regarding safety, no serious adverse events associated with tranilast were noted, except for recurrent diarrhea during the short-term period in one case.The findings suggest that tranilast can inhibit TRPV2 expression for an extended period and is effective in preventing the worsening of cardiac function and subsequent death from heart failure.The study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR: UMIN000031965, URL: http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ ) [March 30, 2018] and the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT, registration number: jRCTs031180038, URL: https://jrct.niph.go.jp/ ) [November 12, 2021].

          "abstract": "Humans can perform movements in various physical environments and positions (corresponding to different experienced gravity), requiring the interaction of the musculoskeletal system, the neural system and the external environment. The neural system is itself comprised of several interactive components, from the brain mainly conducting motor planning, to the spinal cord (SC) implementing its own motor control centres through sensory reflexes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether similar movements in various environmental dynamics necessitate adapting modulation at the brain level, correcting modulation at the spinal level, or both. Here, we addressed this question by focusing on upper limb motor control in various gravity conditions (magnitudes and directions) and using neuromusculoskeletal simulation tools. We integrated supraspinal sinusoidal commands with a modular SC model controlling a musculoskeletal model to reproduce various recorded arm trajectories (kinematics and EMGs) in different contexts. We first studied the role of various spinal pathways (such as stretch reflexes) in movement smoothness and robustness against perturbation. Then, we optimised the supraspinal sinusoidal commands without and with a fixed SC model including stretch reflexes to reproduce a target trajectory in various gravity conditions. Inversely, we fixed the supraspinal commands and optimised the spinal synaptic strengths in the different environments. In the first optimisation context, the presence of SC resulted in easier optimisation of the supraspinal commands (faster convergence, better performance). The main supraspinal commands modulation was found in the flexor sinusoid's amplitude, resp. frequency, to adapt to different gravity magnitudes, resp. directions. In the second optimisation context, the modulation of the spinal synaptic strengths also remarkably reproduced the target trajectory for the mild gravity changes. We highlighted that both strategies of modulation of the supraspinal commands or spinal stretch pathways can be used to control movements in different gravity environments. Our results thus support that the SC can assist gravity compensation.Copyright: © 2025 Bruel et al.

We hypothesize that selective diagnostic nerve block (DNB) of the tibial nerve motor branches can help identify which muscle is primarily responsible for clonus in patients with SEVF and provide useful information for botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) treatment. This retrospective study explored which calf muscles contributed to clonus in 91 patients with SEFV after stroke (n = 31), multiple sclerosis (n = 21), and cerebral palsy (n = 39), using selective DNB. We found that SEVF-associated clonus was most commonly driven by the soleus muscle, followed by the gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis, tibialis posterior, and flexor digitorum longus, and that frequency differed according to SEVF etiology. Our data suggest that identifying the muscles involved in SEVF-associated clonus may aid clinicians in personalizing BoNT-A treatment to single patients.

          "title": "Does force depression resulting from shortening against series elasticity contribute to the activation dependence of optimum length?",
          "abstract": "The optimum length for force generation (L0) increases as activation is reduced, challenging classic theories of muscle contraction. Although the activation dependence of L0 is seemingly consistent with length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity, this mechanism cannot explain the apparent force dependence of L0 or the effect of series compliance on activation-related shifts in L0. We have tested a theory proposing that the activation dependence of L0 relates to force depression resulting from shortening against series elasticity. This theory predicts that significant series compliance would cause tetanic L0 to be shorter than the length corresponding to optimal filament overlap, thereby increasing the activation dependence of L0. We tested this prediction by determining L0 and maximum tetanic force (P0) with (L0_spring, P0_spring) and without added compliance in bullfrog semitendinosus muscles. The activation dependence of L0 was characterized with the addition of twitch and doublet contractions. Springs attached to muscles gave added fixed-end compliances of 11%-39% and induced force depression for tetanic fixed-end contractions (P0_spring < P0). We found strong, negative correlations between spring compliance and both P0_spring (r2 = 0.89-0.91) and L0_spring (r2 = 0.60-0.63; P < 0.001), whereas the activation dependence of L0 was positively correlated to added compliance (r2 = 0.45, P = 0.011). However, since the compliance-mediated reduction in L0 was modest relative to the activation-related shift reported for the bullfrog plantaris muscle, additional factors must be considered. Our demonstration of force depression under novel conditions adds support to the involvement of a stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridge binding.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity does not fully explain the activation dependence of optimum length (L0). We demonstrate using an isolated muscle preparation and added series compliance that substantial force depression can arise during an isometric contraction, causing tetanic L0 to shift to a shorter length. Our findings illustrate that series compliance, via the work and length dependencies of force depression, partially uncouples force generation from myofilament overlap, which ultimately increases the activation (or force) dependence of L0.",

In a double-blinded, crossover study, we measured soleus muscle stretch reflexes and H reflexes and tibialis anterior cutaneous reflexes in 19 healthy subjects before and after nimodipine (tablet 60 mg) or baclofen (tablet 25 mg). Baclofen was used as a control to compare nimodipine's effects with known antispastic treatment. Changes in the size of the maximum H reflex (Hmax)/maximum direct motor response in muscle (Mmax) ratio and stretch and cutaneous reflexes following intervention with nimodipine and baclofen, respectively, were analyzed with a one-way repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA. Nimodipine significantly reduced the Hmax/Mmax ratio [F(2.5,42) = 15; P < 0.0001] and the normalized soleus stretch reflex [F(2.6,47) = 4.8; P = 0.0073] after administration. A similar tendency was seen after baclofen [Hmax/Mmax ratio: F(2.1,39) = 4.0, P = 0.024; normalized stretch reflex: F(2.8,50) = 2.4; P = 0.083]. The Mmax response was unaffected by either intervention. Interestingly, during voluntary soleus activation, the stretch reflex remained unchanged with either treatment. For the cutaneous reflexes, there was a trend toward reduced early inhibition [F(1.6,9.3) = 4.5; P = 0.050] and subsequent facilitation [F(1.3,8.0) = 4.3; P = 0.065] after nimodipine. No severe adverse effects were reported after nimodipine. These findings suggest that nimodipine acutely reduced electrophysiological measures related to spasticity in healthy individuals. The effect seemed located at the spinal level, and voluntary contraction counterbalanced the reduction of the stretch reflex, highlighting its relevance for future studies on antispastic therapies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The calcium channel antagonist nimodipine significantly reduces the size of the soleus H reflex and stretch reflex in healthy individuals without affecting maximum direct motor response (Mmax) or the stretch reflex during voluntary activation. This underscores the importance of exploring nimodipine as a potential antispastic medication in the future.",

          "abstract": "Residual force enhancement (rFE) and residual force depression (rFD) are history-dependent properties of muscle which refer to increased and decreased isometric force following a lengthening or shortening contraction, respectively. The history dependence of force is greater in older than in younger human adults when assessed at the joint level. However, it is unclear whether this amplification of the history dependence of force in old age is owing to cellular mechanisms or is a consequence of age-related remodelling of muscle architecture. Single muscle fibres from the psoas major of old and young F344BN rats were dissected and chemically permeabilized. Single muscle fibres were mounted between a force transducer and length controller, then maximally activated (pCa 4.5). To assess rFD, fibres were actively shortened from 3.1 to 2.5 µm at both a slow (0.15 Lo s-1) and fast (0.6 Lo s-1) speed, with a fixed-end isometric reference contraction at 2.5 µm. To assess rFE, fibres were activated and stretched at 0.3 Lo s-1 from a sarcomere length of 2.2 to 2.5 µm, and 2.7 to 3.0 µm, and compared with fixed-end isometric reference contractions at 2.5 and 3.0 µm, respectively. Isometric force (2.5 µm) was ∼19% lower in muscle fibres from old as compared with young rats (P 0.05). rFD was ∼33% greater in muscle fibres from old as compared with young rats (P 0.05). rFD is amplified in old age at the cellular level, while rFE appears to be unchanged; thus, previously reported age-related modification of rFE occurs upstream from the cellular level.© 2025.

          "abstract": "During the shortening of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs), muscle force output is enhanced compared with pure shortening (SHO), referred to as the SSC-effect. In general, muscle-tendon unit (MTU), muscle belly, muscle fascicle, and tendon length changes can be decoupled during contraction, which affects force generation and elastic recoil. We researched whether MTU decoupling contributes to the SSC-effect. Participants performed electrically stimulated submaximal fixed-end, SSC, and SHO plantar-flexions on a dynamometer at two velocities (40, 120°/s) and two ranges of motion (15, 25°). Fascicle and tendon length changes of the gastrocnemius medialis, and ankle joint kinematics were assessed by ultrasound and motion capture, respectively. During SSC shortening, ankle joint torque and work, MTU force and work, and fascicle force were increased by 12%-22% compared with SHO, confirming a SSC-effect. Further, fascicle length change and velocity during SSCs were significantly reduced compared with SHO condition, and SSC fascicle work was decreased by ~35%. Our results indicate that MTU decoupling leads to a reduction in fascicle shortening amplitude and velocity, thereby increasing the muscle's force capacity while reducing its work output during SSC shortening. MTU decoupling therefore contributes to the SSC-effect and underlines the limited transferability of joint work measurements to estimated muscle work.© 2024 The Author(s).

Before and after the fatigue tasks, changes in estimated muscle force and fascicle length during fast stretching were used to calculate the active muscle stiffness of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. In addition, the thickness of the plantar flexor muscles was measured before and after fatigue tasks.After fatigue tasks, no difference in the relative increase of muscle thickness was found between ISO and ECC. The increase in torque during fast stretching did not change after both ISO and ECC. The increase in fascicle length during fast stretching significantly increased after ECC but not ISO. Active muscle stiffness significantly decreased after ECC but not ISO.Active muscle stiffness decreased after repeated eccentric contractions damaging fascicles and did not change with repeated isometric contractions causing metabolic fatigue.

          "abstract": "The stretch reflex is a fundamental component of the motor system that orchestrates the coordinated muscle contractions underlying movement. At the heart of this process lie the muscle spindles (MS), specialized receptors finely attuned to fluctuations in tension within intrafusal muscle fibres. The tension variation in the MS triggers a series of neuronal events including an initial depolarization of sensory type Ia afferents that subsequently causes the activation of motoneurons within the spinal cord1,2. This neuronal cascade culminates in the execution of muscle contraction, underscoring a presumed closed-loop mechanism between the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. By contrast, here we report the discovery of a new population of macrophages with exclusive molecular and functional signatures within the MS that express the machinery for synthesizing and releasing glutamate. Using mouse intersectional genetics with optogenetics and electrophysiology, we show that activation of MS macrophages (MSMP) drives proprioceptive sensory neuron firing on a millisecond timescale. MSMP activate spinal circuits, motor neurons and muscles by means of a glutamate-dependent mechanism that excites the MS. Furthermore, MSMP respond to neural and muscle activation by increasing the expression of glutaminase, enabling them to convert the uptaken glutamine released by myocytes during muscle contraction into glutamate. Selective silencing or depletion of MSMP in hindlimb muscles disrupted the modulation of the stretch reflex for force generation and sensory feedback correction, impairing locomotor strategies in mice. Our results have identified a new cellular component, the MSMP, that directly regulates neural activity and muscle contraction. The glutamate-mediated signalling of MSMP and their dynamic response to sensory cues introduce a new dimension to our understanding of sensation and motor action, potentially offering innovative therapeutic approaches in conditions that affect sensorimotor function.© 2024.

Stretching and compression exercises are commonly used to treat DGS.To compare the effects of compression or stretching exercises on the flexion-relaxation response (electromyography signals of back muscles) in patients with DGS.In this clinical trial with parallel groups, forty-five eligible patients were randomly allocated into three groups; compression exercise (ICE) (n = 15), stretching exercise (ISE) (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). All treatment groups (control, ICE and ISE) underwent 10 sessions of physiotherapy treatment at a frequency of three per week. The flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) for back muscles was investigated as the primary outcome measure.No significant differences were detected in FRR of back muscles at the end of the study between three study groups (all p > 0.05). In all groups after interventions, no significant changes in FRR compared to the baseline values were observed (within changes were not significant; all p > 0.05). The pairwise comparisons of the between groups revealed that the disability scores in the ISE group compared to ICE, were significantly lower (F = 5.53; df = 2; P = 0.009).Neither stretching nor compression exercises affected FRR more than the control group in DGS patients.

Following a 48-h washout period, the interventions were swapped between the respective groups. Both groups underwent assessments averaging three countermovement vertical jumps (CVJ) with hands on hips and three VJ with arms free. Measurement was taken using the Encoder - Ergonauta I, with over 1500 jumps recorded. The participants were evaluated for their level of flexibility and VJ performance using the Jump Sigma Index application.an acute decrease in average performance was identified, amounting to 3.86 % for the CMJ with hands on hips and 3.06% for the CVJ with free hands, following PNF in the agonists.there was no statistical difference between the means before and after the intervention when PNF was applied to the antagonistic hamstring muscles. The CVJ modalities with hands on hips and with free hands presented statistically similar indices.

          "abstract": "Ely's, Ober's, and modified Thomas' tests are widely used. Stretching the front thigh involves two layers of tissue: the rectus femoris and its overlying fascia lata (FL). However, to our knowledge, no biomechanical study has analyzed these tests. Therefore, this study tries to determine the structures affected during the stretching of the front thigh.An observational study of the front thigh was conducted. The directions and intensities of the reaction forces were recorded. The patellar travel was used to determine the average coordinates of the stretched structures at hip level in the horizontal plane. The participants indicated the stretched area. The stretch of a patient with a complete tear of his left rectus femoris was recorded.The reaction force of the thigh was oriented at 33° (standard deviation [SD]: 6°) sideways and its intensity was 60 N m (SD: 19 N m). The centroid coordinates of all stretched structures were stable. The registered average external rotational torque of 6 N m (SD: 3.7 N m) could only be mediated by the FL. The stretched area indicated by the participants could be anywhere on the FL. The tolerated reaction force increased in the same way on the disinserted rectus femoris thigh and on the uninjured thigh.Ober's, Modified Thomas', and Ely's tests are three potential means of assessing FL extensibility. A lateral patellar tilt may be triggered by the FL's reaction force to stretching. Stretch tolerance seems to be limited by the FL, the fascia profundis of the thigh.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to elucidate whether reciprocal and presynaptic inhibition occurs during KINVIS. Seventeen healthy participants were recruited (mean age: 27.9 ± 3.6 yr), and their soleus Hoffmann-reflexes (H-reflexes) were recorded by peripheral nerve stimulation while perceiving the dorsiflexion kinesthetic illusion in the right-side foot (seated in a comfortable chair).

Unconditioned H-reflex and two types of conditioned H-reflexes were measured: Ia (reciprocal inhibition) and D1 (presynaptic inhibition). Reciprocal Ia and D1 inhibition of the soleus muscle was significantly enhanced during the kinesthetic illusion compared with the condition without kinesthetic illusion (a post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni test: Ia inhibition, P = 0.002; D1 inhibition, P = 0.049). This study indicates that kinesthetic illusion elicits an inhibitory effect on the monosynaptic reflex loop of Ia afferents, potentially inhibiting the hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. These findings demonstrate that brain activity associated with visually induced kinesthetic illusions acts on spinal inhibition circuits. These insights may be valuable in clinical rehabilitation practice, specifically for the treatment of spasticity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural effects in visual-induced kinesthetic illusion expand into the spinal reflex. Kinesthetic illusion inhibits the monosynaptic reflex in an antagonistic muscle via reciprocal and presynaptic inhibition.

          "abstract": "Optimal loading involves the prescription of an exercise stimulus that promotes positive tissue adaptation, restoring function in patients undergoing rehabilitation and improving performance in healthy athletes. Implicit in optimal loading is the need to monitor the response to load, but what constitutes a normal response to loading? And does it differ among tissues (e.g., muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage) and systems? In this paper, we discuss the \"normal\" tissue response to loading schema and demonstrate the complex interaction among training intensity, volume, and frequency, as well as the impact of these training variables on the recovery of specific tissues and systems. Although the response to training stress follows a predictable time course, the recovery of individual tissues to training load (defined herein as the readiness to receive a similar training stimulus without deleterious local and/or systemic effects) varies markedly, with as little as 30 min (e.g., cartilage reformation after walking and running) or 72 h or longer (e.g., eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage) required between loading sessions of similar magnitude. Hyperhydrated and reactive tendons that have undergone high stretch-shorten cycle activity benefit from a 48-h refractory period before receiving a similar training dose. In contrast, bone cells desensitize quickly to repetitive loading, with almost all mechanosensitivity lost after as few as 20 loading cycles. To optimize loading, an additional dose (≤ 60 loading cycles) of bone-centric exercise (e.g., plyometrics) can be performed following a 4-8 h refractory period. Low-stress (i.e., predominantly aerobic) activity can be repeated following a short (≤ 24 h) refractory period, while greater recovery is needed (≥ 72 h) between repeated doses of high stress (i.e., predominantly anaerobic) activity. The response of specific tissues and systems to training load is complex; at any time, it is possible that practitioners may be optimally loading one tissue or system while suboptimally loading another. The consideration of recovery timeframes of different tissues and systems allows practitioners to determine the \"normal\" response to load. Importantly, we encourage practitioners to interpret training within an athlete monitoring framework that considers external and internal load, athlete-reported responses, and objective markers, to contextualize load-response data.© 2024.

          "abstract": "Emerging in vivo evidence suggests that repeated muscle contraction, or exercise, impacts peripheral nerves. However, the difficulty of isolating the muscle-specific impact on motor neurons in vivo, as well as the inability to decouple the biochemical and mechanical impacts of muscle contraction in this setting, motivates investigating this phenomenon in vitro. This study demonstrates that tuning the mechanical properties of fibrin enables longitudinal culture of highly contractile skeletal muscle monolayers, enabling functional characterization of and long-term secretome harvesting from exercised tissues. Motor neurons stimulated with exercised muscle-secreted factors significantly upregulate neurite outgrowth and migration, with an effect size dependent on muscle contraction intensity. Actuating magnetic microparticles embedded within fibrin hydrogels enable dynamically stretching motor neurons and non-invasively mimicking the mechanical effects of muscle contraction. Interestingly, axonogenesis is similarly upregulated in both mechanically and biochemically stimulated motor neurons, but RNA sequencing reveals different transcriptomic signatures between groups, with biochemical stimulation having a greater impact on cell signaling related to axonogenesis and synapse maturation. This study leverages actuating extracellular matrices to robustly validate a previously hypothesized role for muscle contraction in regulating motor neuron growth and maturation from the bottom-up through both mechanical and biochemical signaling.© 2024 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "In primates and other mammals, the capacity to generate a wide maximum jaw gape is an important performance variable related to both feeding and nonfeeding oral behaviors, such as canine gape display and clearing the canines for use as weapons during aggressive encounters. Across sexually dimorphic catarrhine primates, gape is significantly correlated with canine height and with musculoskeletal features that facilitate wide gapes. Given the importance of canine gape behaviors in males as part of intrasexual competition for females, functional relationships between gape, canine height, and musculoskeletal morphology can be predicted to differ between the sexes. We test this hypothesis by investigating sex-specific relationships among these variables in a maximum sample of 32 cercopithecoid species. Using phylogenetic least squares regression, we found that of 18 predicted relationships, 16 of the 18 (89%) were significant in males, whereas only six (33%) were significant in females. Moreover, 15 of the 18 correlations were higher-10 of the 18 significantly higher-in males than in females. Males, but not females, showed strong and significant positive allometry of fiber lengths, indicating that increase in male jaw length is accompanied by allometric increases in the capacity for muscle stretch. While males and females showed significant negative allometry for muscle leverage, only males showed significant negative allometry of muscle leverage relative to jaw gape and canine height. Collectively, these results provide support for the hypothesis that as selection acted to increase relative canine height in male cercopithecoids, one change was an allometric increase in relative maximum jaw gape, along with allometric increases in musculoskeletal morphologies that facilitate gape. Lastly, if gape and canine display/clearance are key targets of selection on masticatory morphology in male cercopithecoids, then cercopithecoid monkeys such as macaques, baboons, and sooty mangabeys may have diminished utility as models for drawing paleobiological inferences from musculoskeletal morphology about feeding behavior and diet in fossil hominins.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

          "title": "The evolution of muscle spindles.",
          "abstract": "Muscle spindles are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors found in the skeletal muscles of most four-limbed vertebrates. They are unique amongst sensory receptors in the ability to regulate their sensitivity by contraction of the intrafusal muscle fibres on which the sensory endings lie. Muscle spindles have revealed a remarkable diversity of functions, including reflex action in posture and locomotion, contributing to bodily self awareness, and influencing wound healing. What were the circumstances which gave rise to the evolution of such complex end-organs? We argue that spindles first appeared in early amniotes and only later in frogs and toads. This was considered an example of convergent evolution. Spindles in amphibians and reptiles are characterised by their simple structure, pointing to key features essential for spindle function. Spindle sensitivity in amphibians and reptiles is controlled by intrafusal fibre contractions evoked by branches of motor axons supplying extrafusal muscle. Modern phylogenetic evidence has revised our views on the origin of birds, placing them closer to the dinosaurs than had previously been thought. Birds are the only group, other than mammals, which has a dedicated fusimotor innervation of spindles, another example of convergent evolution, given the widely different origins of the two groups. One factor that may have played a role here was that both groups are endotherms, allowing motor control to develop further in an optimal internal environment. This, as well as other changes within the spindle, has led to the astonishing sophistication of motor control observed especially in many modern mammals.© 2024 The Author(s).

          "title": "Different effects of cardiomyocyte contractile activity on transverse and axial tubular system luminal content dynamics.",
          "abstract": "Efficient excitation-contraction coupling of mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes depends on the transverse-axial tubular system (TATS), a network of surface membrane invaginations. TATS enables tight coupling of sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, which is essential for rapid Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, and uniform contraction upon electrical stimulation. The majority of TATS in healthy ventricular cardiomyocytes is composed of transverse tubules (TT, ∼90 % of TATS in rabbit). The remainder consists of mostly axial tubules (AT), which are less abundant and less well studied. In disease, however, the relative abundance of TT and AT changes. The mechanisms and relevance of this change are not known, and understanding them requires a more targeted effort to study the dynamics of AT structure and function. While TATS content is continuous with the interstitial space, it is contained within a domain of restricted diffusion. We have previously shown that TT are cyclically squeezed during stretch and contraction. This can contribute to TT content mixing and accelerates luminal content exchange with the environment. Here, we explore the effects of cardiomyocyte stretch and contraction on AT.TATS structure and diffusion dynamics were studied using 3D electron tomography of rabbit left ventricular cardiomyocytes, preserved at rest or during contraction, and ventricular tissue preserved at rest or during stretch, as well as live-cell TATS content exchange measurements.We show (i) that cardiomyocyte contraction is associated with an increase in the apparent speed of diffusion of TT content that scales with beating rate and degree of cell shortening. In contrast, (ii) AT develop membrane folds and constrictions during contraction, (iii) with no effect of contraction on luminal exchange dynamics, while (iv) cardiomyocyte stretch is associated with AT straightening and AT and TT 'squeezing' that (v) supports an acceleration of the apparent speed of diffusion in AT and TT. Finally, (vi) we present a simple computational model outlining the potential relevance of AT in healthy and diseased cells.Our results indicate that TT and AT are differently affected by the cardiac contractile cycle, and suggest that AT may play a role in ensuring TATS network content homogeneity in diseased cardiomyocytes. Further research is needed to explore the interplay of structural and functional remodelling of different TATS components in failing myocardium.Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

This study aims to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive corrective exercise program (CCEP) on the range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation in female athletes with limited weight-bearing lunge ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. 30 female athletes aged 15 to 25 years with dorsiflexion under 34° were randomized to two groups. The intervention group (n = 15) received eight weeks of CCEP including soft tissue mobilization, joint mobilization, stretching, and strengthening, and the control (n = 15) group did not receive any intervention. range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation were assessed before and after the intervention. The training group showed clinically acceptable and statistically significant changes in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ES = 0.714), balance (ES = 0.423), and proprioception (ES = 0.253; P 0.05). The findings show that CCEP appears to be beneficial in increasing dorsiflexion range of motion, proprioception, balance, and decreasing ankle muscle activity among individuals with limited ankle dorsiflexion. Improving the dorsiflexion range of motion may be promising for reducing ankle sprain injury.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

          "title": "Classic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome",
          "abstract": "Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). The skin is soft, velvety, or doughy to the touch. In addition, the skin is hyperextensible, meaning that it extends easily and snaps back after release. The skin is fragile, as manifested by splitting of the dermis following relatively minor trauma, especially over pressure points (knees, elbows) and areas prone to trauma (shins, forehead, chin). Wound healing is poor, and stretching, thinning, and pigmentation of scars is characteristic, leading to the presence of atrophic and/or hemosiderotic scars. Easy bruising is also a hallmark of cEDS. GJH is present in most but not all affected individuals, evidenced by the presence of a Beighton score of five or greater, either on examination or historically. Joint instability complications may comprise sprains and dislocations/subluxations. Mild muscle hypotonia with delayed motor development, fatigue and muscle cramps, and some skeletal morphologic alterations (scoliosis, pectus deformities, genus/hallux valgus, pes planus) are regularly observed. While aortic root dilatation and mitral valve prolapse are seen in cEDS, they are rarely clinically significant. Arterial aneurysm and rupture have been reported in a few individuals with cEDS.The diagnosis of cEDS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL1A1, COL5A1, or COL5A2 identified by molecular genetic testing.Treatment of manifestations: Dermal wounds are closed without tension, preferably in two layers. For other wounds, deep stitches are applied generously; cutaneous stitches are left in place twice as long as usual; and the borders of adjacent skin are carefully taped to prevent stretching of the scar. Young children with skin fragility can wear pads or bandages over the forehead, knees, and shins to avoid skin tears. Older children can wear soccer pads or ski stockings with shin padding during activities. Braces as needed to improve joint stability; referral to orthopedist, rheumatologist, or physical therapist and occupational therapist as needed. Mobility devices as needed. Adjust sleep surface as needed to improve sleep quality and decrease pain. Those with hypotonia, joint instability, and chronic pain may need to adapt lifestyles accordingly. Anti-inflammatory drugs may alleviate joint pain. Children with hypotonia and delayed motor development benefit from physiotherapy. Non-weight-bearing exercise promotes muscle strength and coordination. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may reduce bruising. DDAVP® (desmopressin) may be useful to normalize bleeding time. Cardiovascular manifestations are treated in a standard manner. Surveillance: Assess for skin fragility, joint instability, occupational and physical therapy needs, mobility issues, and pain at each visit or as needed. Evaluation for hypotonia and motor development at each visit in infants and children. Assess for easy bruising and/or prolonged bleeding at each visit. Evaluation of clotting factors if severe easy bruising is present. Yearly echocardiogram when aortic dilatation and/or mitral valve prolapse are present. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sports with heavy joint strain.Classic EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with cEDS have an affected parent; approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with cEDS have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with cEDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the cEDS-related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.Copyright © 1993-2025, University of Washington, Seattle.

For the assessment, the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) has been widely used owing to its simplicity and convenience.

The proposed system consists of a joint angle calculation algorithm, a function to detect abnormal muscle reaction (a catch and clonus), and a visual biofeedback mechanism. Through spastic knee and ankle joint assessment, the proposed IMU-based MTS assessment system was compared with the conventional MTS assessment system in 28 children with cerebral palsy by two raters.The results showed that the proposed system has good accuracy (root mean square error 0.8), while the conventional MTS system has poor or moderate reliability.

However, the PR of extraocular muscle (EOM) is almost never measured because of experimental constraints. The problem was overcome by determining changes in EOM dimensions using computed X-ray tomography (CT) at microscopic resolution during tensile elongation to determine transverse strain indicated by the change in cross-section. Fresh bovine EOM specimens were prepared. Specimens were clamped in a tensile fixture within a CT scanner (SkyScan, Belgium) with temperature and humidity control and stretched up to 35% of initial length. Sets of 500-800 contiguous CT images were obtained at 10-micron resolution before and after tensile loading. Digital 3D models were then built and discretized into 6-8-micron-thick elements. Changes in longitudinal thickness of each microscopic element were determined to calculate strain. Green's theorem was used to calculate areal strain in transverse directions orthogonal to the stretching direction. The mean PR from discretized 3D models for every microscopic element in 14 EOM specimens averaged 0.457 ± 0.004 (SD). The measured PR of bovine EOM is thus near the limit of incompressibility.",

Potential influences of muscle fatigue of extensor muscles have not been explored.A total of 20 asymptomatic subjects performed submaximal isometric trunk extension exertions and an isokinetic trunk flexion before and immediately after 5-minute static flexion while the trunk sagittal flexion angle and the myoelectric activities (electromyography [EMG]) of back extensor muscles were recorded simultaneously. Changes in the flexion-relaxation onset angle, maximum flexion angle, muscle activity level, and the median power frequency of EMG associated with the static flexion were evaluated.Flexion-relaxation onset angle in isokinetic flexion and EMG amplitude of isometric extension were significantly greater after static flexion, indicating creep of spinal tissues in static flexion. Median power frequency of lumbar erector spinae EMG during isometric extension was significantly lower after static flexion, suggesting the development of muscle fatigue. Consistent but low level of EMG was observed together with sporadic muscle spasms during the static flexion period.Fatigue of low back extensor muscles may occur in static flexion due to prolonged passive stretching of the muscles. Low back extensor muscles are required to generate more active forces in weight holding or lifting after static flexion to compensate for the reduced contribution of creep deformed passive tissues in maintaining spinal stability and the posture. The degraded force generating capacity of the fatigued muscles can be a significant risk factor for low back pain.",

          "abstract": "Full flexion lumbar postures maintained over a prolonged period of time have been shown to lead to changes in the supporting passive structures of the spine and it has been hypothesized that this may lead to low back pain/disorders. However, the specific biomechanics and physiology of this link have not been fully developed. Of particular interest is the interplay between the active and passive extensor mechanisms and the role of rest break in this response.Ten healthy participants performed a regimen of a 10-min full lumbar flexion followed by a 10-min upright standing, with a slow speed isokinetic lift every 2.5min. Changes in the full lumbar flexion angle (system creep) and the electromyographic activity of back extensors in the isokinetic lifts were evaluated.Results showed significant increases in the full flexion angle and increased activity of the extensor muscles in the prolonged flexion to compensate for the reduced extension moment producing capability of the passive tissues. A 30-s rest break in the middle of the flexion moderated these viscoelastic responses.The results suggest that prolonged lumbar flexion results in the systematic transfer of an extension moment from passive tissues to active muscles. Heavy lifting or high force exertion of back muscles immediately after prolonged flexion could be a risk factor for low back disorders when the muscles lose their force generating capacity due to passive stretching. This study also indicated the importance of sufficient rest between consecutive full flexion tasks in reducing the risk.",

          "abstract": "The application of mustard oil (MO), a small-fibre excitant and inflammatory irritant, into neck paraspinal muscles of the rat has been shown to produce a significant reflexive increase in electromyographic (EMG) activity in both neck and jaw muscles. It is possible that this nociceptive reflex activity is influenced by muscle length since recent evidence indicates that abnormal neck posture may be associated with cervical musculoskeletal disorders and pain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test if muscle length modulates this nociceptive reflex response. Three different experimental procedures were employed in rats under halothane anesthesia: (1) MO injected into the left deep neck muscles with the rat placed in a straight body position (Straight group, n = 7); (2) MO injected into lengthened left deep neck muscles with the rat's neck rotated 45 degrees to the right with respect to the head (Stretched group, n = 11); and (3) MO injected into the right deep neck muscles with the rat's neck rotated 45 degrees to the right (Relaxed group, n = 9). The EMG activity of the deep neck, trapezius, and digastric muscles was bilaterally recorded, rectified and integrated into area under the curve (AUC). Control injections of the vehicle, mineral oil, did not evoke any muscle activity but MO evoked EMG activity in the ipsilateral deep neck and trapezius muscles of the Stretched group that was significantly greater than that evoked in the same muscles in the Straight and Relaxed groups. Also, the MO-evoked EMG activity in the contralateral deep neck muscles of the Stretched and Relaxed groups was greater than that of the corresponding muscles in the Straight group. The MO-evoked activity in the digastric, a jaw muscle whose length was not changed, did not show any significant difference between the three groups. These findings indicate that MO application to the rat deep neck muscles results in a larger nociceptive reflex in deep neck and trapezius muscles when they are stretched. This enhanced muscle activity could be associated with changes in the susceptibility of the neck muscles to pain or damage.",

          "abstract": "Calcium influx is known to be prerequisite for membrane fusion of myoblasts. However, little is known about the channels that are responsible for the entry of calcium into the cells. Here we show that K(Ca) channels and stretch-activated channels are involved in the calcium influx. Upon analysis of single-channel recordings, calcium sensitivity of K(Ca) channels in myoblasts was found to be about sixfold higher than that in myotubes. Their density in myoblasts (1.68 micron(-2)) was also about sixfold higher than that in myotubes (0.27 micron(-2)). In addition, the opening of the calcium-permeable cationic channels in myoblasts was found to increase with membrane stretching and could be blocked by gadolinium. The density of stretch-activated channels was 0.22 micron(-2) for myoblasts, and the relative permeability of calcium to potassium was P(Ca)/P(K) approximately 3.6. The channels could generate inward calcium currents to open K(Ca) channels in physiological solution. Furthermore, the activation of K(Ca) channels by phloretin dramatically hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential of myoblasts and this effect could be reversed upon treatment of tetraethylammonium. While phloretin induced precocious fusion, tetraethylammonium or gadolinium blocked not only the phloretin-induced precocious fusion but also the spontaneous fusion of myoblasts. These results suggest that hyperpolarization generated by reciprocal activation of stretch-activated channels and K(Ca) channels is involved in the calcium influx that triggers myoblast fusion.",

On examination, he had tenderness to palpation at the left side of the sacrum and in the region of the deep external rotators. Left hip range of motion was full in extension but limited to 90° of flexion, which reproduced left-sided buttock pain. External rotation provoked pain, but internal rotation was full and pain free. MRI of the pelvis demonstrated a grade 2 partial thickness tear of the left gluteus maximus muscle at its distal myotendinous junction with associated retraction and intramuscular hematoma.

          "title": "Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (Greater Trochanteric Bursitis)",
          "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with lateral hip pain are commonly treated for trochanteric bursitis using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. While effective for many, this approach still leaves many patients with ongoing discomfort and limited functionality. Recent advancements in understanding have led to the recognition of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) as a more accurate descriptor of this condition. GTPS encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. Trochanteric bursitis, the predominant cause of GTPS, involves inflammation of the greater trochanteric bursa, which is located between the greater trochanter and the iliotibial band. This inflammation is commonly triggered by repetitive stress and trauma. The condition manifests as pain in the lateral thigh, often aggravated by prolonged sitting, stair climbing, or engaging in high-impact exercises. The hip joint, bearing loads of 6 to 8 times the body weight during everyday activities, is particularly vulnerable to wear and tear. The diagnosis of GTPS is primarily clinical, with imaging used to differentiate it from other potential causes. A deep understanding of the relevant anatomy, clinical examination findings, and imaging results is essential in managing cases resistant to conservative treatment. The standard treatment includes NSAIDs, physical therapy, and stretching exercises. Surgical intervention, both open and endoscopic, is reserved for cases where conservative methods are ineffective. Involved Anatomical Structures Dysfunction at any anatomical junction can manifest as greater trochanteric pain syndrome. The peritrochanteric space contains important anatomical structures that enable hip motion and stability. A key structure is the subgluteus maximus bursa, also called the trochanteric bursa, which cushions movements of the overlying gluteus tendons, iliotibial band, and tensor fascia lata. The peritrochanteric space is superficially covered by a fibromuscular sheath comprising the gluteus maximus, tensor fascia lata, and iliotibial band. Underneath lie the hip abductor and stabilizer muscles. The gluteus minimus stabilizes the femoral head, originating from the pelvis and inserting at the greater trochanter. The larger gluteus medius also inserts at the greater trochanter, initiates hip abduction, and stabilizes the femoral head. Finally, the tensor fascia lata forms the prime hip abductor. Proper functioning of these muscular and connective tissue structures enables painless motion and transfers weight laterally from the hip during gait. Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

Thirty-seven formalin-fixed cadavers and one soft-fixed cadaver were used in this study. Gluteal tissue was removed from five formalin-fixed cadavers. A horizontal section and sections parallel to the long axis of the body were made from the excised tissue, and the subcutaneous fat was removed to observe the fibrous structure within the subcutaneous fat. Two formalin-fixed cadavers and one soft-fixed cadaver were used to perform conventional gross anatomical dissection and histological examination. On 30 formalin-fixed cadavers, the thickness of the subcutaneous fat was measured in various areas of the buttocks. The thickness of subcutaneous fat was thicker in the center of the buttocks and thinner on the lateral buttocks. Superficial fascia (SF) was found only in the upper buttock, being indistinct in the lower buttock. In the sacral and coccygeal areas, the dermis was tightly adhered to the bone as a single mass. Fibers arose from around the iliac crest to the SF. On the medial side of the gluteal fold, a strong fiber arose from the sciatic tubercle and inserted into the gluteus maximus and dermis. By identifying the characteristic subcutaneous structures of the gluteal region, we were able to identify the anatomical structures that shape the three-dimensional morphology of the buttocks. These findings may be useful in surgical treatments such as improving the buttock shape.© 2022 American Association of Clinical Anatomists and British Association of Clinical Anatomists.",

During the pelvic fracture reduction, circumpelvic muscles deformation is closely related to the surgical accuracy. In this article, the biomechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissue during pelvic fracture reduction are studied. Five-parameter hyperelastic model named Mooney-Rivlin is adopted to analyze muscle's stress-strain relationship. The finite element model of the injured pelvic musculoskeletal tissue is established, and the deformation of circumpelvic main muscles is simulated. Then, the dynamic simulation of pelvic fracture reduction is performed according to the planned spatial reduction path. The results show that when the muscles are stretched the same stretch length, the strain of the gluteus medius is the largest. It is most prone to deformation under and the muscle injury is most easily to occur. During the pelvic fracture reduction, the strain of gluteus maximus is the largest, and it is most prone to deformation and injury. The traction length is the largest, and the traction force mainly comes from the gluteus maximus. This study provides reference for the robot assisted pelvic fracture reduction.",

          "abstract": "Abductor deficiency after total hip arthroplasty is a severe complication with functional limitations and a significant reduction in the patient's quality of life. Common causes are degenerative ruptures or approach-related iatrogenic damage to the gluteus medius and minimus muscle and the inferior gluteal nerve, fractures of the greater trochanter and incorrect reconstruction of leg length and femoroacetabular offset. With a standardised diagnosis consisting of a clinical examination, conventional X-ray and MRI, the causes of the functional problems can often be reliably determined. Therapy of abductor deficiency is challenging for both patients and physicians and is often tedious. However, with a clear diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm and straightforward patient education, good treatment results can be achieved even in this challenging condition. Conservative therapy with eccentric stretching and muscle strengthening are the basis of the treatment. In cases of progression of complaints despite intensive conservative treatment, various anatomical and extra-anatomical surgical reconstruction methods are available to relieve pain and improve function. Anatomical reconstruction of the gluteal tendon insertion is an option in cases of low-grade fatty infiltration and moderate retraction of the gluteal muscles. In situations with advanced degenerative changes in the gluteus medius and minimus muscles and an intact gluteus maximus muscle, transfer of the anterior portion of the gluteus maximus according to Whiteside is an option. For high-grade defects of the soft tissue, there is also the option of an isolated or combined transfer of the vastus lateralis muscle.Thieme. All rights reserved.",

Pelvic anterior tilting and rotation angles were measured during each PHE exercise via electromagnetic motion tracking. A modified Thomas test was used to examine the hip extension angle before and after iliopsoas stretching. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to investigate differences in pelvic anterior tilting and rotation angle and in hip and back extensor muscle activities among PHE, PHEA, and PHEAS. The level of statistical significance was set at α= 0.01.GM muscle activity was significantly greater with PHEAS, compared to PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01). Bilateral ES and ipsilateral BF and ST muscle activities were significantly reduced with PHEAS, compared to PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01).

          "abstract": "The central nervous system of humans and other animals modulates spinal cord activity to achieve several locomotion behaviors. Previous neuromechanical models investigated the modulation of human gait changing selected parameters belonging to CPGs (Central Pattern Generators) feedforward oscillatory structures or to feedback reflex circuits. CPG-based models could replicate slow and fast walking by changing only the oscillation's properties. On the other hand, reflex-based models could achieve different behaviors through optimizations of large dimensional parameter spaces. However, they could not effectively identify individual key reflex parameters responsible for gait characteristics' modulation. This study investigates which reflex parameters modulate the gait characteristics through neuromechanical simulations. A recently developed reflex-based model is used to perform optimizations with different target behaviors on speed, step length, and step duration to analyze the correlation between reflex parameters and their influence on these gait characteristics. We identified nine key parameters that may affect the target speed ranging from slow to fast walking (0.48 and 1.71 m/s) as well as a large range of step lengths (0.43 and 0.88 m) and step duration (0.51, 0.98 s). The findings show that specific reflexes during stance significantly affect step length regulation, mainly given by positive force feedback of the ankle plantarflexors' group. On the other hand, stretch reflexes active during swing of iliopsoas and gluteus maximus regulate all the gait characteristics under analysis. Additionally, the results show that the hamstrings' group's stretch reflex during the landing phase is responsible for modulating the step length and step duration. Additional validation studies in simulations demonstrated that the modulation of identified reflexes is sufficient to regulate the investigated gait characteristics. Thus, this study provides an overview of possible reflexes involved in modulating speed, step length, and step duration of human gaits.",

Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adding inter-set SS to a lower-limb flywheel RT program on joint flexibility, muscular strength, and regional hypertrophy. Sixteen untrained male adults (21 ± 1 y) completed the study, where they performed progressive flywheel bilateral squatting twice a week for 5 weeks. One leg of each participant was randomly allocated to perform SS during the inter-set rest period (RT+SS), while the other leg served as control (RT only). Before and after the intervention, knee flexion range of motion; knee extension isometric, concentric, and eccentric peak torque; 1-repetition maximum; and muscle thickness of the lower-limb muscles were assessed. Following the training period, additional effects were observed for the inter-set SS side on increasing joint flexibility (p < 0.05), whereas the average increase in strength measures was 5.3% for the control side, and 10.1% for the inter-set SS side, however, SS intervention induced significantly greater gains only for knee extension isometric strength, but not for dynamic 1-RM, concentric, and eccentric tests. Hamstrings and gluteus maximus did not hypertrophy with training; increases quadriceps muscle thickness depended on the site/portion analyzed, but no significant difference was observed between legs (average: RT = 7.3%, RT+SS = 8.0%). The results indicate that adding inter-set SS to RT may provide large gains in flexibility, slightly benefits for muscular strength (especially for isometric action), but do not impact muscle hypertrophy in untrained young men.",

Few studies have considered the effects of stretch-induced residual force enhancement (rFE) and shortening-induced residual force depression (rFD) during an SSC, and none have considered these properties during voluntary contractions. With force matched via a robotically resisted Smith machine, we hypothesized that in the isometric steady-state following an SSC (a) muscle activation (electromyography) of the knee and hip extensors would be greater and (b) muscle oxygen consumption be higher than the reference isometric condition (ISO), but less than the rFD condition. Subjects (n = 20, male, 24.9 ± 3.9 year) performed a squat exercise over 100-140° knee angle and a matched ISO at the top and bottom of the squat. After active shortening, the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and gluteus maximus (GM) showed activation increase in the rFD-state compared with ISO (∼15%, ∼11%, and ∼25% respectively). During the isometric steady-state following the SSC, there was no difference in activation as compared with ISO for VM, VL, but GM showed an activation increase of ∼15%. VM and VL showed an activation increase in the rFD-state compared with the isometric steady-state following SSC (∼16 and ∼10% respectively). Muscle oxygen consumption (tissue saturation index) was not different during the isometric steady-states following rFD and SSC compared with ISO. During a voluntary SSC exercise, the activation increase expected in the FD-state was attenuated, with no change in muscle oxygen consumption. The concomitant role of rFE and rFD during a voluntary position-matched SSC seems to counteract shortening-induced activation increase and may optimize movement economy.",

          "abstract": "Objective To assess the relationship between static frontal knee alignment in asymptomatic subjects and flexibility of the main muscles functionally related to the knee. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 33 healthy adults (19-31 years). The frontal knee angle (valgus/varus angle) was measured by photogrammetry and it was measured in the lateral side. Therefore, high values were assigned for genu varum and low values for genu valgum. Iliopsoas, gluteus maximus and medius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, vastus of the quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles were stretched. Muscles were classified as normal, reflex hypomobile, or structural hypomobile. Results Women had significantly greater valgus than did men (right angle, women: 174.41°/men: 177.41°; left angle, women: 174.20°/men: 178.70°). The right frontal plane knee angle was higher in women with structural hypomobile vastus. The left frontal plane knee angle was higher in women with structural hypomobile iliopsoas. No relationships were found in men. Conclusions A tighter vastus of the quadriceps and tighter iliopsoas are related to greater genu varum in adult women. Stretching the vastus of the quadriceps and iliopsoas when there is a tendency for excess varus in the knee, to prevent overuse injury or early osteoarthritis, might be clinically relevant.",

Prescriptions and training for a daily, high-load, prolonged, home self-stretching program were primarily based on the baseline coefficient of shortening, defined as CSH = [(XN -XV1)/XN] (XV1 = PROM, passive range of motion; XN = normally expected amplitude).Six assessments were performed per year, measuring the Tardieu XV1 or maximal slow stretch range of motion angle (PROM), CSH, 10-m ambulation speed, and its functional ambulation category (Perry's classification: household, limited, or full). Changes from baseline in self-stretched and nonself-stretched muscles were compared, with meaningful XV1 change defined as ΔXV1 >5° for plantar flexors and >10° for proximal muscles. Correlation between the composite XV1 (mean PROM for the 6 muscles) and ambulation speed also was evaluated.Twenty-seven GSC participants were identified (14 women, mean age 44 years, range 29-59): 18 with hemiparesis and 9 with paraparesis. After 1 year, 47% of self-stretched muscles showed meaningful change in PROM (ΔXV1) versus 14% in nonself-stretched muscles (P < .0001, χ2). ΔCSH was -31% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -41.5 to -15.2) in self-stretched versus -7% (95% CI -11.9 to -2.1) in nonself-stretched muscles (P < .0001, t-test). Ambulation speed increased by 41% (P < .0001) from 0.81 m/s (95% CI 0.67-0.95) to 1.15 m/s (95% CI 1.01-1.29).

          "abstract": "The human iliotibial band (ITB) is a poorly understood fascial structure that may contribute to energy savings during locomotion. This study evaluated the capacity of the ITB to store and release elastic energy during running, at speeds ranging from 2-5m/s, using a model that characterizes the three-dimensional musculoskeletal geometry of the human lower limb and the force-length properties of the ITB, tensor fascia lata (TFL), and gluteus maximus (GMax). The model was based on detailed analyses of muscle architecture, dissections of 3-D anatomy, and measurements of the muscles' moment arms about the hip and knee in five cadaveric specimens. The model was used, in combination with measured joint kinematics and published EMG recordings, to estimate the forces and corresponding strains in the ITB during running. We found that forces generated by TFL and GMax during running stretch the ITB substantially, resulting in energy storage. Anterior and posterior regions of the ITB muscle-tendon units (MTUs) show distinct length change patterns, in part due to different moment arms at the hip and knee. The posterior ITB MTU likely stores more energy than the anterior ITB MTU because it transmits larger muscle forces. We estimate that the ITB stores about 1J of energy per stride during slow running and 7J during fast running, which represents approximately 14% of the energy stored in the Achilles tendon at a comparable speed. This previously unrecognized mechanism for storing elastic energy may be an adaptation to increase human locomotor economy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of loading on lower limb muscle coordination involved during ballistic squat jumps. Twenty athletes performed ballistic squat jumps on a force platform. Vertical force, velocity, power and electromyographic (EMG) activity of lower limb muscles were recorded during the push-off phase and compared between seven loading conditions (0-60% of the concentric-only maximal repetition). The increase in external load increased vertical force (from 1962 N to 2559 N; P=0.0001), while movement velocity decreased (from 2.5 to 1.6 ms(-1); P=0.0001). EMG activity of tibialis anterior first peaked at 5% of the push-off phase, followed by gluteus maximus (35%), vastus lateralis and soleus (45%), rectus femoris (55%), gastrocnemius lateralis (65%) and semitendinosus (75%). This sequence of activation (P=0.67) and the amplitude of muscle activity (P=0.41) of each muscle were not affected by loading condition. However, a main effect of muscle was observed on these parameters (peak value: P<0.001; peak occurrence: P=0.02) illustrating the specific role of each muscle during the push-off phase. Our findings suggest that muscle coordination is not influenced by external load during a ballistic squat jump.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

One hundred voluntary male athletes participated in this study.

After a 2-minute brief rest period, participants performed 3 trials of VJ test followed by one of the treatment protocols. Vertical jump performance was evaluated by countermovement jump (CMJ). Participants were divided into 3 groups according to their flexibility and prejump performances after warm-up. For each individual group and the whole group, after all treatments, differences in CMJ values were obtained (p ≤ 0.05). Ballistic stretching increased the VJ performance in the groups with low and average flexibility, poor prejumping performance, and also in the whole group (p ≤ 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching + BS affected VJ performance in the group of participants with high flexibility (p ≤ 0.05). Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation + SS decreased VJ performance in groups of participants with high flexibility, moderate, and high prejumping performance and in whole group (p ≤ 0.05).

          "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in hamstring flexibility in 120 asymptomatic children who participated in a 6-week program consisting of one physiotherapy session per week and daily home exercises. The recruitment criteria included age (10-13 years), no pain, injury or musculoskeletal disorder throughout the previous year, physical activity limited to school sport. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) post-isometric relaxation - PIR (n = 40), (2) static stretch combined with stabilizing exercises - SS (n = 40) and (3) stabilizing exercises - SE (n = 40). Hamstring flexibility was assessed with straight leg raise (SLR), popliteal angle (PA) and finger-to-floor (FTF) tests. The examinations were conducted by blinded observers twice, prior to the program and a week after the last session with the physiotherapist. Twenty-six children who did not participate in all six exercise sessions with physiotherapists were excluded from the analysis. The results obtained by 94 children were analyzed (PIR, n = 32; SS, n = 31; SE, n = 31). In the PIR and SS groups, a significant (P 0.05). SLR result in the PIR and SS groups was significantly (P<0.001) higher than in the SE group. As far as PA results are concerned, a significant difference was observed only between the SS and SE groups (P = 0.014). There were no significant (P = 0.15) differences regarding FTF results between the three groups. Post-isometric muscle relaxation and static stretch with stabilizing exercises led to a similar increase in hamstring flexibility and trunk forward bend in healthy 10-13-year-old children. The exercises limited to straightening gluteus maximus improved the SLR result, but did not change the PA and FTF results.",

          "abstract": "Back extension exercises are often used in the rehabilitation of low back pain. However, at present it is not clear how the posterior muscles are recruited during different types of extension exercises. Therefore, the present study will evaluate the myoelectric activity of thoracic, lumbar and hip extensor muscles during different extension exercises in healthy persons. Based on these physiological observations we will make recommendations regarding the use of extensions exercises in clinical practice.Fourteen healthy subjects performed four standardized extension exercises (dynamic trunk extension, dynamic-static trunk extension, dynamic leg extension, dynamic-static leg extension) in randomized order at an intensity of 60% of 1-RM (one repetition maximum). Surface EMG signals of Latissimus dorsi (LD), Longissimus thoracis pars thoracic (LTT) and lumborum (LTL), Iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracic (ILT) and lumborum (ILL), lumbar Multifidus (LM) and Gluteus Maximus (GM) were measured during the various exercises. Subsequently, EMG root mean square values were calculated and compared between trunk and leg extension exercises, as well as between a dynamic and dynamic-static performance using mixed model analysis. During the dynamic exercises a 2 second concentric contraction was followed by a 2 second eccentric contraction, whereas in the dynamic-static performance, a 5 second isometric interval was added in between the concentric and eccentric contraction phase.In general, the muscles of the posterior chain were recruited on a higher level during trunk extension (mean ± SD, 56.6 ± 30.8%MVC) compared to leg extension (47.4 ± 30.3%MVC) (p ≤ 0.001). No significant differences were found in mean muscle activity between dynamic and dynamic-static performances (p = 0.053). The thoracic muscles (LTT and ILT) were recruited more during trunk extension (64.9 ± 27.1%MVC) than during leg extension (54.2 ± 22.1%MVC) (p = 0.045) without significant differences in activity between both muscles (p = 0.138). There was no significant differences in thoracic muscle usage between the dynamic or dynamic-static performance of the extension exercises (p = 0.574).The recruitment of the posterior muscle chain during different types of extension exercises was influenced by the moving body part, but not by the type of contraction. All muscle groups were activated at a higher degree during trunk extension compared to leg extension. Based on the recruitment level of the different muscles, all exercises can be used to improve the endurance capacity of thoracic muscles, however for improvement of lumbar muscle endurance leg extension exercises seem to be more appropriate.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the influence of fast dynamic stretching (FDS) of the gluteus maximus muscle on rate of force development.This study included 12 healthy ice hockey players. The intervention was based on a fast dynamic stretching of the gluteus maximus muscle. For quantification, measurements were performed before and after the intervention. The rate of force development was determined by using the drop jump (DJ) for ground contact time and jump height, and sprint time was measured on ice over 20 meters.The intervention showed significant extension of the ground reaction time. The jump height and the sprint time showed no significant differences after FDS intervention.The data in this present randomised controlled pilot study showed that FDS interventions on the gluteus maximus muscle have no influence on rate of force development.

As such, interventions for EAMC typically consist of stretching/strengthening of the involved muscle and/or supplements to restore electrolyte imbalances.The patient was a 42-year-old male triathlete with a primary complaint of recurrent cramping of his right hamstring muscle, which prevented him from completing races at his desired pace. Strength testing revealed gluteus maximus muscle weakness bilaterally. Electromyographic (EMG) analysis (surface electrodes, 1560 Hz) revealed that the right hamstrings were being activated excessively during terminal swing and the first half of the stance phase (48.1% maximum voluntary isometric contraction [MVIC]).Following the intervention, the patient was able to complete 3 triathlons without hamstring cramping. Strength testing revealed that the right hip extension strength improved from 35.6 to 54.7 kg, and activation of the hamstrings during terminal swing and the first half of the stance phase decreased to 36.4% of MVIC.A program of gluteus maximus strengthening and neuromuscular training eliminated EAMC of the hamstrings in this patient. Given that the hamstrings and gluteus maximus work as agonists to decelerate the thigh during terminal swing phase and control hip flexion during loading response of running, we postulate that strengthening of the gluteus maximus decreased the relative effort required by the hamstrings, thus reducing EAMC. The results of the EMG evaluation that was performed as part of this case report provides support for this hypothesis.Therapy, level 4.",

          "abstract": "We have reported that peak hip extension is nearly identical in walking and running, suggesting that anatomical constraints, such as flexor muscle tightness may limit the range of hip extension. To obtain a more mechanistic insight into mobility at the hip and pelvis we examined the lengths of the muscle-tendons units crossing the hip joint. Data defining the three-dimensional kinematics of 26 healthy runners at self-selected walking and running speeds were obtained. These data were used to scale and drive musculoskeletal models using OpenSIM. Muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengths were calculated for the trailing limb illiacus, rectus femoris, gluteus maximus, and biceps femoris long head and the advancing limb biceps femoris and gluteus maximus. The magnitude and timing of MTU length peaks were each compared between walking and running. The peak length of the right (trailing limb) illiacus MTU, a pure hip flexor, was nearly identical between walking and running, while the maximum length of the rectus femoris MTU, a hip flexor and knee extensor, increased during running. The maximum length of the left (leading limb) biceps femoris was also unchanged between walking and running. Further, the timing of peak illiacus MTU length and peak contralateral biceps femoris MTU length occurred essentially simultaneously during running, at a time during gait when the hamstrings are most vulnerable to stretch injury.

Variables such as net moment and power about the joint were calculated during the descending and ascending phases of each squat. Using surface electrodes placed over the 8 lower extremity muscles, %iEMG was calculated during the ascending phase of each squat.In the descending phase, activities of the following 7 muscles were significantly greater for the quick squat (QS) than the normal squat (NS) or slow squat (SS): erector spinae (ES), gluteus maximus (Gmax), gluteus medius (Gmed), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), adductor longus (AL), and vastus lateralis (VL). Median frequency (MDF) of the Gmax muscle was significantly lower for NS than QS, and activity of the BF was significantly lower for NS than QS or SS. Mean moment of the hip joint was significantly lower for SS than QS. In the ascending phase, activities of the following 7 muscles were significantly greater for QS and NS than SS: ES, Gmax, Gmed, RF, BF, AL, and VL. MDF of the Gmax muscle was significantly lower for NS than QS, and the activity of the BF was significantly lower for NS than QS or SS. Mean moment of the hip joint was significantly higher for QS than SS or NS. Mean moment of the knee was significantly lower for SS than NS or QS.For QS, a stretch-shortening cycle increased the load on the Gmax.

          "abstract": "Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the leg muscles and the ground reaction forces were recorded in 17 elite male middle-distance runners, who performed isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) as well as running at different speeds. Electromyograms were recorded from the gluteus maximus, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. The results indicated that the averaged EMG (aEMG) activities of all the muscles studied increased (P < 0.05) with increasing running speed, especially in the pre-contact and braking phases. At higher speeds, the aEMG activities of the gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and gluteus maximus exceeded 100% MVC in these same phases. These results suggest that maximal voluntary contractions cannot be used as an indicator of the full activation potential of human skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the present results suggest that increased pre-contact EMG potentiates the functional role of stretch reflexes, which subsequently increases tendomuscular stiffness and enhances force production in the braking and/or propulsive phases in running. Furthermore, a more powerful force production in the optimal direction for increasing running speed effectively requires increased EMG activity of the two-joint muscles (biceps femoris, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius) during the entire running cycle.",

          "abstract": "The ankle plantar flexors were previously shown to support the body in single-leg stance to ensure its forward progression [J. Biomech. 34 (2001) 1387]. The uni- (SOL) and biarticular (GAS) plantar flexors accelerated the trunk and leg forward, respectively, with each opposing the effect of the other. Around mid-stance their net effect on the trunk and the leg was negligible, consistent with the body acting as an inverted pendulum. In late stance, their net effect was to accelerate the leg and trunk forward, consistent with an active push-off. Because other muscles are active in the beginning and end of stance, we hypothesized that their active concentric and eccentric force generation also supports the body and redistributes segmental power to enable body forward progression. Muscle-actuated forward dynamical simulations that emulated observed walking kinematics and kinetics of young adult subjects were analyzed to quantify muscle contributions to the vertical and horizontal ground reaction force, and to the acceleration and mechanical power of the leg and trunk. The eccentric uniarticular knee extensors (vasti, VAS) and concentric uniarticular hip extensors (gluteus maximus, GMAX) were found to provide critical support to the body in the beginning of stance, before the plantar flexors became active. VAS also decelerated the forward motion of both the trunk and the leg. Afterwards when VAS shortens in mid-stance, it delivered the power produced to accelerate the trunk and also redistributed segmental power to the trunk by continuing to decelerate the leg. When present, rectus femoris (RF) activity in the beginning of stance had a minimal effect. But in late stance the lengthening RF accelerated the knee and hip into extension, which opposed swing initiation. Though RF was lengthening, it still accelerated the trunk forward by decelerating the leg and redistributing the leg segmental power to the trunk, as SOL does though it is shortening instead of lengthening. Force developed from highly stretched passive hip structures and active force produced by the uniarticular hip flexors assisted GAS in swing initiation. Hamstrings (HAM) decelerated the leg in late swing while lengthening and accelerated the leg in the beginning of stance while shortening. We conclude that the uniarticular knee and hip extensor muscles are critical to body support in the beginning of stance and redistribution of segmental power by muscles throughout the gait cycle is critical to forward progression of the trunk and legs.",

          "abstract": "Knee flexion contracture due to quadriceps paralysis is a major handicap in poliomyelitis patients. The patient has to stabilize the knee with the ipsilateral hand to achieve weight bearing and the deformed knee precludes use of orthopedic devices. Extension can be achieved with supracondylar femoral osteotomy if the knee flexion contracture is less than 30 degrees. We assessed functional and anatomic outcome.We reviewed the files of 87 patients who had undergone 93 supracondylar femoral osteotomies for knee flexion contracture (6 bilateral cases); mean age was 18 years and mean flexion was 25 degrees. The surgical correction was achieved by diaphyseal metaphyseal impaction with resection of an anterior wedge and preservation of the posterior component of the articulation. If some gluteus maximus activity was retained and the tibiotarsal joint was in a slightly equine position, weight bearing in a stable locked position became an automatic postural event even in case of total paralysis of the quadriceps. Osteotomy was not possible if the contracture flexion was greater than 30 degrees due to excessive tension on the vaculonervous bundles. The procedure was equally impossible in children under 12 years of age due to the risk of recurrence subsequent to migration and callus remodeling with bone growth.Complete extension of the knee was achieved peroperatively in all cases. The most serious complications were three cases of septic arthritis that led to an irreducible stiff knee. In addition, we had two cases of transient paralysis of the common fibular nerve that recovered spontaneously. Bone fusion was achieved in all cases within 30 days. Recurrent flexion contracture was observed in 5 cases and required a revision using the same procedure in 3 or them. Postoperatively, the amplitude gained in knee extension corresponded to the amplitude lost for flexion. Sixty-three patients were able to walk independently without manual stabilization and a knee extension orthesis could be installed for 19 others. Three patients were still unable to walk despite the correction of the knee flexion contracture due to failure of poorly accepted orthopedic devices.Several conservative methods (physiotherapy, manipulations, successive corrective casts) and surgical procedures (release of posterior soft tissues, Ilizarov technique) have been proposed for the correction of paralytic knee flexion contracture. Supracondylar femoral osteotomy for extension can be useful after the end of growth if the flexion contracture remains below 30 degrees. The procedure is simple and morbidity is relatively low compared with the regularly successful results. When the flexion contracture exceeds 30 degrees, the supracondylar osteotomy cannot be employed due to the risk of stretching the vasculonervous bundles and due to the instability and disorganization of the lower femur. Progressive correction can be proposed for these patients: regular monitoring of the neurological and vascular situation is required. Functional improvement is considerable after correction of knee flexion contracture. The patients can walk more easily, no longer need to stabilize their knee with their hand, and can benefit from orthopedic devises due to the more favorable biomechanical conditions.",

          "abstract": "The objective of the present work was to study the interaction between the tendon elasticity, the muscle activation-loading dynamics, specific actions of the biarticular muscles, preloading and jumping performance during maximal vertical jumping. Six male expert jumpers participated in the study. They performed maximal vertical jumps with five different preloads. The kinematics and dynamics of the jumping movements were analysed from force plate and high speed film recordings. The amount of elastic energy stored in the tendons of the leg extensor muscles was calculated by a generalised tendon model, and the muscle coordination was analysed by surface EMG. The best jumping performances were achieved in the jumps with low preloads (counter movement jumps and drop jumps from 0.3 m). A considerable amount of the energy imposed on the legs by prestretch loading was stored in the tendons (26 +/- 3%), but the increased performance could not be explained by a contribution of elastic energy to the positive work performed during the push off. During the preloading, the involved muscles were activated at the onset of the loading. Slow prestretches at the onset of muscle activation under relatively low average stretch loads, as observed during counter movement jumps and drop jumps from 0.3 m, prevented excessive stretching of the muscle fibres in relation to the tendon length changes. This consequently conserved the potential of the muscle fibres to produce positive work during the following muscle-tendon shortening in concert with the release of the tendon strain energy. A significant increase in the activity of m. rectus femoris between jumps with and without prestretch indicated a pronounced action of m. rectus femoris in a transport of mechanical energy produced by the proximal monoarticular m. gluteus maximus at the hip to the knee and thereby enhanced the transformation of rotational joint work to translational work on the mass centre of the body. The changes in muscle activity were reflected in the net muscle powers. Vertical jumping is like most movements constrained by the intended direction of the movement. The movements of the body segments during the prestretches induced a forward rotation and during the take off, a backward rotation of the body. A reciprocal shift in the activities of the biarticular m. rectus femoris and m. semitendinosus indicated that these rotations were counteracted by changes in the direction of the resultant ground reaction vector controlled by these muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

A total of 60 right-handed asymptomatic students participated in the study. Participants (N = 22) characterised by asymmetry in rotational movements were selected for the experimental group. A difference of ≥10° between right and left rotation of the cervical spine was considered asymmetrical. The control group (N = 38) included participants whose rotation difference was < 10°. Belonging to the experimental or control group did not significantly differentiate trapezius muscle stiffness. The rotation side differentiated the stiffness of the right and left trapezius muscles only in the group of people with rotational movement asymmetry. There were high correlation coefficients between right cervical rotation and the stiffness of the muscle on the right side, and between rotation to the left and the stiffness of the muscle on the left side. There is a relationship between the stiffness of the right and left upper trapezius muscles and the range of right and left rotational motion of the cervical spine. Stiffness of the upper trapezius correlates more strongly with rotation to the side on which the muscle lies than to the opposite side. Increased stiffness of the upper trapezius muscle on the side of limited cervical spine rotation is likely to be determined by the muscle fibre stretching mechanism.Copyright: © 2024 Wendt, Waszak.

The goal of the present study was to create a standardised TTM protocol to treat office syndrome (OS) diagnosed based on the identification of the palpation of at least one so-called myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in the upper trapezius muscle. The new 90 min TTM protocol, which was developed following appropriate review of the literature and in consultation with relevant experts, has 25 distinct steps (20 pressing steps, 2 artery occlusion steps, and 3 stretching steps). Eleven TTM therapists treated three patients each using the new 90 min TTM protocol. All of the therapists reported scores greater than 80% in respect to their satisfaction and confidence to deliver the protocol, and all of the patients gave the treatment a satisfaction score of greater than 80%. The treatment produced a significant reduction in pain intensity measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 10 cm, of 2.33 cm (95% CI (1.76, 2.89 cm), p < 0.001) and significant increase in pain pressure threshold (PPT) of 0.37 kg/cm2 (95% CI (0.10, 0.64 kg/cm2), p < 0.05). The protocol was revised based on the feedback and the results obtained, and the new standardised TTM protocol will be applied in a randomised control trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of TTM and conventional physical therapy (PT) for treating OS.",

The pathogenesis of HSP is complex, and muscle hypertonia, especially the hypertonia of internal rotation muscles of the shoulder, may be one of the important causes of shoulder pain. However, the relationship between muscle stiffness and HSP has not been well studied. The purpose of this study is to explore the correlations between the stiffness of internal rotation muscles and clinical symptoms in patients with HSP.A total of 20 HSP patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited for this study. The stiffness of internal rotation muscles was quantified using shear wave elastography, and Young's modulus (YM) of the pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD), teres major ™, and latissimus dorsi (LD) were measured. Muscle hypertonia and pain intensity were evaluated using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), respectively. The mobility of the shoulder was evaluated using the Neer score. The correlations between muscle stiffness and the clinical scales were analyzed.YM of internal rotation muscles on the paretic side was higher than that of the control group in the resting and passive stretching positions (P < 0.05). YM of internal rotation muscles on the paretic side during passive stretching was significantly higher than that at rest (P < 0.05). YM of PM, TM, and LD during passive stretching were correlated with MAS (P < 0.05). In addition, the YM of TM during passive stretching was positively correlated with VAS and negatively correlated with the Neer score (P < 0.05).Increased stiffness of PM, TM, and LD was observed in patients with HSP.

          "abstract": "Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) is a relatively common stretch injury of the brachial plexus sustained during delivery. Tendon transfers are commonly performed to improve shoulder function among patients with OBPP. Although several techniques for the surgical management of OBPP exist, it is unclear whether tendon transfers to the rotator cuff vs. posterior humerus yield different outcomes.A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to January 1, 2021, was performed. Relevant publications were classified by surgical technique of tendon transfers to the rotator cuff or posterior humerus. The standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare preoperative and postoperative aggregate Mallet scores as well as abduction and external rotation scores using the Mallet scale. A p value of <0.01 was considered significant.Data from 26 studies and 951 patients (46.2% male patients) with a mean age of 68.9 ± 29.3 months were included. Eight hundred three patients underwent tendon transfer to the rotator cuff and 148 to the posterior humerus. The average postoperative follow-up period was 45.2 ± 21.7 months. The pooled cohort had an overall improvement in postoperative aggregate Mallet scores (SMD = 5.53, p < 0.001), abduction scores (SMD = 1.79, p < 0.001), and external rotation scores (SMD = 1.99, p < 0.001). Tendon transfer to the rotator cuff had a greater postoperative improvement in abduction (SMD = 1.90, p < 0.001) than transfer to the posterior humerus (SMD = 1.32, p < 0.001) while both techniques yielded similar improvements in external rotation (rotator cuff SMD = 2.01, p < 0.001, posterior humerus SMD = 1.98, p < 0.001).This is the first systematic review comparing outcomes for tendon transfers to the rotator cuff vs. the posterior humerus for improving shoulder function in patients with OBPP. Overall, tendon transfers are an effective treatment for improving shoulder function. Transfer of the latissimus dorsi and teres major to the rotator cuff compared with transfer to the posterior humerus results in greater improvement in abduction while both techniques have similar results in improving external rotation.Level I Systematic review of Level I and Level II studies.Copyright © 2023 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.",

The session's goal was to focus on breathing exercises, spine mobility, and stretching of the back muscles, with particular attention to the diaphragmatic, paravertebral, and latissimus dorsi muscles.Assessments such as Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Sit and Reach flexibility test, Roland-Morris Questionnaire, and health status questionnaire (SF12) were used.The evaluation of all outcomes in four measurement periods of the study (baseline, 4, 12, and 24 weeks) showed a significant difference between the groups. Also, at the 6 months of the intervention, a significant difference in the means (SD) was observed in pain (VAS), back flexibility (Sit & Reach) and back disability (QRM) outcomes in favor of the experimental group with a medium-large effect size compared with the control group.The MM approach can also be applied to established conventional protocols to alleviate pain and functionality. The obtained results include improving the quality of life of the athletes and their physical and emotional states.",

Good hamstring flexibility is fundamental to sporting performance and is associated with prevention of injuries of these muscles. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of self-myofascial release (SMR) on hamstring flexibility and determine which segment of the SBL resulted in the greatest increase in flexibility.94 volunteers were randomly assigned to a control group or to one of the five intervention groups. In the intervention groups, SMR was applied to one of the five segments of the SBL (plantar fascia, posterior part of the sural fascia, posterior part of the crural fascia, lumbar fascia or epicranial aponeurosis) for 10 min. The analyzed variables were hamstring flexibility at 30 s, 2, 5, and 10 min, and dorsiflexion range of motion before and after the intervention.Hamstring flexibility and ankle dorsiflexion improved when SMR was performed on any of the SBL segments. The segments with the greatest effect were the posterior part of the sural fascia when the intervention was brief (30 s to 2 min) or the posterior part of the crural fascia when the intervention was longer (5 or 10 min). In general, 50% of the flexibility gain was obtained during the first 2 min of SMR.The SBL may be considered a functional structure, and SMR to any of the segments can improve hamstring flexibility and ankle dorsiflexion.",

The aim of this study was to compare muscle elasticity between the healthy and the involved sides in children with neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) using the elastography tool and to assess whether the difference was correlated with the Mallet grading system. We repeatedly measured the shear modulus coefficient of several muscles around the shoulder in stretched or passively relaxed positions on 14 patients. We evaluated the abductor muscles (supraspinatus and deltoid), the infraspinatus, the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. We found a mean shear modulus significantly higher in most studied muscles in the pathologic side (P < 0.001), especially in the stretched position (P < 0.001). Moreover, the shear modulus increases with the degradation of the Mallet score for the abduction and external rotation tasks.

The following seven trunk positions were chosen as the LD stretching positions; upright of the trunk (Baseline), flexion of the trunk (Flex), contralateral bending of the trunk (LB), contralateral rotation of the trunk (Rot), flexion and contralateral bending of the trunk (Flex + LB), flexion and contralateral rotation of the trunk (Flex + Rot), and contralateral bending and contralateral rotation of the trunk (LB + Rot). Maximal elevation of the upper limb was passively added to all positions. The shear elastic modulus, used as the index of muscle elongation, was measured at the four parts (upper, middle, lower, distal parts) of the LD. The shear elastic moduli showed obviously high values in Rot and LB + Rot at the upper, middle, and distal parts, and also in LB, Rot, and LB + Rot at the lower part. These findings suggest that contralateral trunk rotation, or a combination of contralateral trunk bending and rotation are effective trunk positions for stretching all parts of the LD.

Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67).

          "abstract": "Trapezius Myalgia (TM) is characterized by shoulder pain and dysfunction. Kinesio Taping is commonly used in symptom management of TM. Biomechanical Taping (BMT), a novel intervention, may provide equally effective management.This paper reports on the effectiveness of Biomechanical Taping compared with Kinesio Taping in improving shoulder pain, active range of motion (AROM), and function.Two groups of participants with TM were recruited through simple random sampling of participants from nine call centers and purposively-sampled participants from one fast-food chain and one community based rehabilitation center in Manila, Philippines. Participants were randomly allocated to either Kinesio Taping or biomechanical taping group in a double-blind clinical trial. Irrespective of the type of taping, participants performed gentle passive stretching of upper trapezius for six times each held for 30 s on Days 1, 3, and 5. On Days 2 and 4, participants performed gentle passive stretch of upper trapezius three times a day. Pre- and post-intervention measures were taken of Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity, AROM for shoulder movement, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand for function.Of 68 participants, 62 had shoulder symptoms secondary to TM. Similar significant within group improvements were found for Visual Analogue Scale scores, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand for biomechanical taping and Kinesio Taping interventions when comparing between group results (p < 0.05).Biomechanical Taping appears to be as effective as Kinesio Taping in the short term in decreasing pain and improving function of individuals with TM.

          "abstract": "Prolonged sitting at work can lead to adverse health outcomes. The health risk of office workers is an increasing concern for the society and industry, with prolonged sitting work becoming more prevalent.This study aimed to explore the variation in muscle activities during prolonged sitting work and found out when and how to take a break to mitigate the risk of muscle symptoms.A preliminary survey was conducted to find out the prevalence of muscle discomfort in sedentary work. Firstly, a 2-h sedentary computer work was designed based on the preliminary study to investigate the variation in muscle activities. Twenty-four participants took part in the electromyography (EMG) measurement study. The EMG variations in the trapezius muscle and latissimus dorsi were investigated. Then the intervention time was determined based on the EMG measurement study. Secondly, 48 participants were divided into six groups to compare the effectiveness of every break type (passive break, active break of changing their posture, and stand and stretch their body with 5 or 10 mins). Finally, data consisting of EMG amplitudes and spectra and subjective assessment of discomfort were analyzed.In the EMG experiment, results from the joint analysis of the spectral and amplitude method showed muscle fatigue after about 40 mins of sedentary work. In the intervention experiment, the results showed that standing and stretching for 5 mins was the most effective break type, and this type of break could keep the muscles' state at a recovery level for about 30-45 mins.This study offers the possibility of being applied to office workers and provides preliminary data support and theoretical exploration for a follow-up early muscle fatigue detection system.© 2020 The Authors.",

          "abstract": "Composite chest wall reconstruction, following the assurance of chest wall stability, often requires well-vascularized soft tissue coverage with flaps to insure adequate wound healing. Unfortunately, prior surgical approaches such as the posterolateral thoractomy incision or extensive wound breakdown may impede the availability of local or regional choices. A free flap would then be a reasonable option, but in the unstable patient a new donor site is unreasonable. Instead, the otherwise inadequate muscle remnants often transected by the usual thoracotomy incision can be extended by microvascular grafts to provide the necessary reach to the defect.The ipsilateral cephalic latissimus dorsi and/or serratus anterior muscle remnants following their transection by a posterolateral thoractomy incision can be simultaneously raised as a chimeric flap pedicled in common by the thoracodorsal vessels. The distance the pedicle must be extended to reach the defect requiring coverage is measured, and a vascular graft from the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral vessels of the same length is harvested. The thoracodorsal vessels are divided, the vascular graft inserted and anastomosed end-to-end to the cut ends of the former, and then the flap can be stretched the required distance for insetting.A case example of use of the ipsilateral latissimus dorsi-serratus anterior muscle remnants used after extension with arterial and venous grafts to the thoracodorsal vessels as the recipient site is presented with successful salvage of a life-threatening posteriolateral thoractomy wound dehiscence.Transection of muscles from a posterolateral thoracotomy incision does not preclude their use as flaps in extenuating circumstances.

          "title": "Can Myofascial Interventions Have a Remote Effect on ROM? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
          "abstract": "Anatomical and in vivo studies suggest that muscles function synergistically as part of a myofascial chain. A related theory is that certain myofascial techniques have a remote and clinically important effect on range of motion (ROM).To determine if remote myofascial techniques can effectively increase the range of motion at a distant body segment.In November 2018, the authors searched 3 electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and PEDro) and hand-searched journals and conference proceedings. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials comparing remote myofascial techniques with passive intervention (rest/sham) or local treatment intervention. The primary outcome of interest was ROM. Quality assessment was performed using the PEDro Scale. Three authors independently evaluated study quality and extracted data. RevMan software was used to pool data using a fixed-effect model.Eight randomized controlled trials, comprising N = 354 participants were included (mean age range 22-36 y; 50% female). Study quality was low with PEDro scores ranging from 2 to 7 (median scores 4.5/10). None of the studies incorporated adequate allocation concealment and just 2 used blinded assessment of outcomes. In all studies, treatments and outcomes were developed around the same myofascial chain (superficial back line). Five studies included comparisons between remote interventions to sham or inactive controls; pooled results for ROM showed trends in favor of remote interventions (standard mean difference 0.23; 95% confidence intervals; -0.09 to 0.55; 4 studies) at immediate follow-ups. Effects sizes were small, corresponding to mean differences of 9% or 5° in cervical spine ROM, and 1 to 3 cm in sit and reach distance. Four studies compared remote interventions to local treatments, but there were few differences between groups.Remote exercise interventions may increase ROM at distant body segments. However, effect sizes are small and the current evidence base is limited by selection and measurement bias.",

          "abstract": "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries, by definition, exceed the endogenous repair capacity of skeletal muscle resulting in permanent structural and functional deficits. VML injuries present a significant burden for both civilian and military medicine. Despite progress, there is still considerable room for therapeutic improvement. In this regard, tissue-engineered constructs show promise for VML repair, as they provide an opportunity to introduce both scaffolding and cellular components. We have pioneered the development of a tissue-engineered muscle repair (TEMR) technology created by seeding muscle progenitor cells onto a porcine-derived bladder acellular matrix followed by cyclic stretch preconditioning before implantation. Our work to date has demonstrated significant functional repair (60-90% functional recovery) in progressively larger rodent models of VML injury following TEMR implantation. Notwithstanding this success, TEMR implantation in cylindrically shaped VML injuries in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was associated with more variable functional outcomes than has been observed in sheet-like muscles such as the latissimus dorsi. In fact, previous observations documented a dichotomy of responses following TEMR implantation in a rodent TA VML injury model; with an ≈61% functional improvement observed in fewer than half (46%) of TEMR-implanted animals at 12 weeks postinjury. This current study builds directly from those observations as we modified the geometry of both the VML injury and the TEMR construct to determine if improved matching of the implanted TEMR construct to the surgically created VML injury resulted in increased functional recovery posttreatment. Following these modifications, we observed a comparable degree of functional improvement in a larger proportion of animals (≈67%) that was durable up to 24 weeks post-TEMR implantation. Moreover, in ≈25% of all TEMR-implanted animals, functional recovery was virtually complete (TEMR max responders), and furthermore, the functional recovery in all 67% of responding animals was accompanied by the presence of native-like muscle properties within the repaired TA muscle, including fiber cross-sectional area, fiber type, vascularization, and innervation. This study emphasizes the importance of tuning the application of tissue engineering technology platforms to the specific requirements of diverse VML injuries to improve functional outcomes. Impact Statement This report confirms and extends previous observations with our implantable tissue-engineered technology platform for repair of volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries. Based on our prior work, we addressed factors hypothesized to be responsible for significant outcome variability following treatment of VML injuries in a rat tibialis anterior model. Through customization of the muscle repair technology to a specific VML injury, we were able to significantly increase the frequency at which functional recovery occurred, and furthermore, demonstrate durability out to 6 months. In addition, the enhanced biomimetic qualities of repaired muscle tissue were associated with the most robust functional outcomes.",

Therefore, it is the purpose of this research study to compare the lower extremity muscle and upper extremity muscle activation patterns associated with the curveball pitch and the fastball pitch from the stretch position. Twelve skilled (NCAA collegiate level) pitchers volunteered to be in this study, with a mean age of 22.3 ± 4.53 years, mean height of 1.74 ± 0.13 m, and mean mass of 89.0 k ± 10.97 kg. The pitchers were fitted with six surface electromyography (EMG) bipolar electrodes on the stride leg biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, ipsilateral side lower trapezius, upper trapezius, triceps brachii and biceps brachii. Each pitcher underwent maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) testing and then performed the fastball & curveball pitching sequence. All EMG variables of interest were normalized using MVIC data and compared between pitching type. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for all muscle activity as well. If significance was found a pairwise analysis (Bonferroni) was performed between pitch type, using SPSS (p 0.05). Significant differences in the mean muscle activity for the fastball and curveball pitched from the stretch were observed. A higher level of muscle activity was found for the stretch fastball when compared to the stretch curveball.

Mobility at the SIJ is very limited but increases during pregnancy and the post-partum period. Familiarity with the anatomy and physiology of the SIJ is important. The SIJ is a diarthrodial joint that connects two variably undulating cartilage surfaces, contains synovial fluid, and is enclosed within a capsule strengthened by several ligaments. This lecture does not discuss rheumatic or inflammatory diseases of the SIJ, whose diagnosis relies on imaging studies and blood tests. Instead, it focuses on micro-traumatic lesions. Micro-trauma causes chronic SIJ pain, which must be differentiated from hip pain and spinal pain. The diagnosis rests on specific clinical provocation tests combined with a local injection of anaesthetic. Findings are normal from radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Non-operative treatment with exercise therapy and stretching aims primarily to strengthen the latissimus dorsi, gluteus, and hamstring muscles to increase SIJ coaptation. Other physical treatments have not been proven effective. Radiofrequency denervation of the dorsal sensory rami has shown some measure of efficacy, although the effects tend to wane over time.

          "abstract": "The lumbar paraspinal muscle compartment (PMC) is a stabilizing system of the spine whose efficiency depends on its elastic properties, which may be quantifiable by supersonic shear wave elastography (SWE). The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) encapsulates the lumbar paraspinal muscles (LPM) and creates a PMC. Tensioning of the TLF via the stretching of the latissimus dorsi is supposed to increase stiffness within the PMC. The aims of this study were (1) to test the reliability of SWE in the multifidus and the erector spinae (ES) in prone and sited position; (2) to investigate the role of the tensioning of the pTLF, via stretching of the latissimus dorsi (LD), on LPM stiffness. Stiffness of ES and multifidus was measured using SWE at L3-L4 in procubitus and seated position in 15 participants. Stretching of LD was performed with arm elevation. Parametric paired tests, multiple analyses of variance, and intraclass correlation were used for statistical analysis. Reliability estimates were fair to excellent. Reliability was greater in ES than the multifidus, greater in seated position than during rest. Stiffness was greater in the ES than in multifidus, and in seated position than at rest. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not generate significant LPM stiffness changes. SWE is a reliable tool for assessing stiffness in the LPM. Reliability of SWE protocols is improved during seated position. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not influence LPM stiffness. Clin.

The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the difference between therapist administered and self-administered interventions.Three arm assessor-blinded Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT).Fifty-eight asymptomatic participants (16 Males; Mean age 22.69 ± 2.65 years).Participants with tight hamstrings defined by a passive Knee Extension Angle (KEA) > 20° were included in the study and were assigned to one of the three groups. Group A (n = 19) was SS, group B (n = 20) was remote MFR, group C (n = 19) was a combination group who received both SS and remote MFR. Seven sessions of therapist administered intervention were delivered over a period of 10 days, which was followed by a 2-week self-administered home program. KEA and Sit and Reach Test (SRT) were used as outcomes and measurements were performed at baseline, end of the seventh session and after atwo-week follow-up.The results demonstrated that hamstring flexibility improved in all three groups after therapist administered interventions (p 0.05) change in the KEA with self-intervention.The findings of this study indicated that all three interventions were effective in improving hamstring flexibility in young asymptomatic individuals when performed by the therapist.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate thrust manipulation targeting the cervicothoracic junction compared to a manual stretch of the upper trapezius muscle on cervical range of motion and upper trapezius pressure pain thresholds (PPTs).Healthy participants with no significant history of neck pain were randomized into a thrust manipulation group, a stretching group, or a control group.

After a single session, TG increased the tidal volume of the pulmonary rib cage (Vrcp) (p=0.020) and tidal volume of abdominal rib cage (Vrca) (p=0.043) variations and their percentages in relation to the thoracic wall, Vrcp% (p=0.044) and Vrca% (p=0.022). Also, TG decreased the end-expiratory Vrcp (p=0.013) and the end-inspiratory Vrcp (p=0.011) variations. In addition, there was a reduction in respiratory rate (RR) (p=0.011) and minute volume (MV) (p=0.035), as well as an increase in expiratory time (Te) (p=0.026).

The most common reason is an iatrogenic injury during surgery but other causes such as stretch or traction injury have also been reported. Five iatrogenic SAN injuries were occurred after radical neck dissection (RND) for laryngeal carcinoma in two patients, lymphadenectomy for oral mucosal tumor in one patient, surgery for lipoma in one patient, and lymph node biopsy for tuberculosis in one patient, traumatic SAN injuries were occurred after the carrying and lifting in three patients. Our eight patients were followed conservatively and 6 of them had significant improvement of pain and function of the shoulder. However, the remaining two patients with radical neck dissection showed moderate improvement in both pain and function including shoulder range of motion and activities of daily living. We report the eight cases with SAN injury that had admitted to our outpatient clinic in the last one year with neck, back and shoulder pain as well as limitation in the shoulder range of motion and difficulty in the activities of daily living.",

          "abstract": "Chronic neck/shoulder pain (CNSP) is one of the most common pain conditions. The understanding of mechanisms, including the peripheral balance between nociceptive and antinociceptive processes, is incomplete. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a class of endogenous compounds that regulate inflammation and pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of two NAEs: the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type-α ligand palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and stearoylethanolamide (SEA) in the muscle interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP randomized to two different neck specific training programs and in a healthy pain-free control group (CON).Fifty-seven women with CNSP were randomized to strength + stretch or stretch alone exercise programs. Twenty-nine subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months of exercise. Twenty-four CON subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months without any intervention in between. Microdialysate samples were collected from the trapezius muscle and analyzed by mass spectrometry for PEA and SEA levels.PEA and SEA levels were significantly higher in CNSP patients compared with CON. PEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after both training programs. SEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after stretch alone but not after strength + stretch training. A significant positive correlation was found between changes in pain intensity and in SEA levels in the strength + stretch group, but not in the stretch alone group.Our results indicate that exercise interventions differentially affect the levels of the bioactive lipids PEA and SEA in the interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP.Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

          "abstract": "This investigation was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of stretch-shortening cycling (SSC(EFF)) in upper-limb extensor muscles while cross-country skiing using the double-poling technique (DP). To this end, SSC(EFF) was analyzed in relation to DP velocity and performance. Eleven elite cross-country skiers performed an incremental test to determine maximal DP velocity (V(max)). Thereafter, cycle characteristics, elbow joint kinematics and poling forces were monitored on a treadmill while skiing at two sub-maximal and racing velocity (85% of V(max)). The average EMG activities of the triceps brachii and latissimus dorsi muscles were determined during the flexion and extension sub-phases of the poling cycle (EMG(FLEX), EMG(EXT)), as well as prior to pole plant (EMG(PRE)). SSC(EFF) was defined as the ratio of aEMG(FLEX) to aEMG(EXT). EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) increased with velocity for both muscles (P < 0.01), as did SSC(EFF) (from 0.9 ± 0.3 to 1.3 ± 0.5 for the triceps brachii and from 0.9 ± 0.4 to 1.5 ± 0.5 for the latissimus dorsi) and poling force (from 253 ± 33 to 290 ± 36N; P < 0.05). Furthermore, SSC(EFF) was positively correlated to Vmax, to EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) (P < 0.05). The neuromuscular adaptations made at higher velocities, when more poling force must be applied to the ground, exert a major influence on the DP performance of elite cross-country skiers.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to examine the effects of different muscle relaxation techniques on the physical properties of the trapezius muscle and to explore how changes in the physical properties of the upper trapezius muscle affect those of the middle trapezius muscle. Twenty-four healthy males (mean age: 23.08 ± 0.97 years; height: 172.42 ± 4.61 cm; weight: 66.38 ± 6.68 kg; and body mass index: 22.30 ± 1.81 kg/m2), randomly divided into four groups: stretching relaxation group (ST, n = 6), mechanical vibration massage (MV, n = 6), pulse massage (PU, n = 6), and control (CO, n = 6). Measurements using the Myoton digital muscle assessment system were conducted daily over 2 weeks. The experimental groups demonstrated a notable decrease in tension and stiffness, accompanied by heightened elasticity in the upper trapezius muscles. Conversely, the control group exhibited contrasting trends. Although no significant variances were detected among the relaxation techniques, all proved efficacious compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, relaxation of the upper trapezius muscles significantly influenced the middle trapezius muscles (P < 0.05).

RSP can lead to shoulder dysfunction. Different methods have been proposed for rehabilitating and correcting the altered posture in RSP including stretching, strengthening exercises, and shoulder brace or taping. However, the findings are controversial and studies are ongoing to develop more effective method. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of scapular posterior tilting (SPT) exercise in different support positions on scapular muscle activities in men and women with RSP. In a prospective observational clinical study, we assessed demographic, basic clinical parameters and study variables of the subjects with RSP (n = 20) (men/women = 9/11) attending Daegu University in Gyeongsan, South Korea. To do so, we compared electromyographic (EMG) activities of lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles between men and women with RSP during SPT exercise on four different support surfaces to determine any difference in the EMG activities. The results revealed that women showed significant differences in EMG activities in the lower and left upper trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, while men showed significant differences in EMG activity only in the lower trapezius muscle during SPT exercise on four different surfaces (P 0.0125).© 2024.

A total of 60 right-handed asymptomatic students participated in the study. Participants (N = 22) characterised by asymmetry in rotational movements were selected for the experimental group. A difference of ≥10° between right and left rotation of the cervical spine was considered asymmetrical. The control group (N = 38) included participants whose rotation difference was < 10°. Belonging to the experimental or control group did not significantly differentiate trapezius muscle stiffness. The rotation side differentiated the stiffness of the right and left trapezius muscles only in the group of people with rotational movement asymmetry. There were high correlation coefficients between right cervical rotation and the stiffness of the muscle on the right side, and between rotation to the left and the stiffness of the muscle on the left side. There is a relationship between the stiffness of the right and left upper trapezius muscles and the range of right and left rotational motion of the cervical spine. Stiffness of the upper trapezius correlates more strongly with rotation to the side on which the muscle lies than to the opposite side. Increased stiffness of the upper trapezius muscle on the side of limited cervical spine rotation is likely to be determined by the muscle fibre stretching mechanism.Copyright: © 2024 Wendt, Waszak.

The patients completed the Numeric Pain Scale, Neck Disability Index, and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index before, after, and 1 month after the treatment.All variables were significantly reduced within both groups by time and treatment separately (P < .001), while a general comparison among the groups showed a significant reduction for all variables in the intervention group compared with the comparison group (P < .05) except for shoulder disability (P = .114). Moreover, the intervention group had better results compared with the comparison group based on the minimal clinically important difference.A combination of TECAR therapy, exercise, and medication substantially reduced symptom severity for patients with MPS in the upper trapezius when compared to only exercise and medication.© 2023 by National University of Health Sciences.",

          "abstract": "Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) is a relatively common stretch injury of the brachial plexus sustained during delivery. Tendon transfers are commonly performed to improve shoulder function among patients with OBPP. Although several techniques for the surgical management of OBPP exist, it is unclear whether tendon transfers to the rotator cuff vs. posterior humerus yield different outcomes.A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to January 1, 2021, was performed. Relevant publications were classified by surgical technique of tendon transfers to the rotator cuff or posterior humerus. The standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare preoperative and postoperative aggregate Mallet scores as well as abduction and external rotation scores using the Mallet scale. A p value of <0.01 was considered significant.Data from 26 studies and 951 patients (46.2% male patients) with a mean age of 68.9 ± 29.3 months were included. Eight hundred three patients underwent tendon transfer to the rotator cuff and 148 to the posterior humerus. The average postoperative follow-up period was 45.2 ± 21.7 months. The pooled cohort had an overall improvement in postoperative aggregate Mallet scores (SMD = 5.53, p < 0.001), abduction scores (SMD = 1.79, p < 0.001), and external rotation scores (SMD = 1.99, p < 0.001). Tendon transfer to the rotator cuff had a greater postoperative improvement in abduction (SMD = 1.90, p < 0.001) than transfer to the posterior humerus (SMD = 1.32, p < 0.001) while both techniques yielded similar improvements in external rotation (rotator cuff SMD = 2.01, p < 0.001, posterior humerus SMD = 1.98, p < 0.001).This is the first systematic review comparing outcomes for tendon transfers to the rotator cuff vs. the posterior humerus for improving shoulder function in patients with OBPP. Overall, tendon transfers are an effective treatment for improving shoulder function. Transfer of the latissimus dorsi and teres major to the rotator cuff compared with transfer to the posterior humerus results in greater improvement in abduction while both techniques have similar results in improving external rotation.Level I Systematic review of Level I and Level II studies.Copyright © 2023 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.",

Good hamstring flexibility is fundamental to sporting performance and is associated with prevention of injuries of these muscles. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of self-myofascial release (SMR) on hamstring flexibility and determine which segment of the SBL resulted in the greatest increase in flexibility.94 volunteers were randomly assigned to a control group or to one of the five intervention groups. In the intervention groups, SMR was applied to one of the five segments of the SBL (plantar fascia, posterior part of the sural fascia, posterior part of the crural fascia, lumbar fascia or epicranial aponeurosis) for 10 min. The analyzed variables were hamstring flexibility at 30 s, 2, 5, and 10 min, and dorsiflexion range of motion before and after the intervention.Hamstring flexibility and ankle dorsiflexion improved when SMR was performed on any of the SBL segments. The segments with the greatest effect were the posterior part of the sural fascia when the intervention was brief (30 s to 2 min) or the posterior part of the crural fascia when the intervention was longer (5 or 10 min). In general, 50% of the flexibility gain was obtained during the first 2 min of SMR.The SBL may be considered a functional structure, and SMR to any of the segments can improve hamstring flexibility and ankle dorsiflexion.",

A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67). In conclusion, MED appears to improve in office workers after a six week training program, which may be explained by a decrease in trapezius tone and increase in the left middle trapezius tone.",

However, a daily report of pain reduction has not been determined.The aim was to evaluate the time of the greatest pain relief after performing a single session of DN in MTrPs of the upper trapezius muscle.A patient who had MTrPs in the upper trapezius muscle was enrolled into a prospective descriptive study. Each patient received a single session of DN, using a fast-in-fast-out technique, with needle retention for 30 min. Numerical rating scale (NRS) scores were collected daily for 14 days. The mean difference of pain and an effect size were calculated. The 1-5 satisfaction score was a secondary outcome.Sixty-seven subjects completed the intervention. The mean duration of the symptom was 27.32 months. The mean baseline NRS score was 5.30. The pain decreased significantly between immediate post-procedure and 1 day after the DN treatment from 5.16 to 3.40 (mean difference 1.76, p < 0.01, effect size = 0.87). The pain continuously reduced until day 10 and then it gradually rose. The pain on day 10 was compared with the baseline that revealed the largest effect size of 3.08 (mean difference 4.67, p < 0.01). Eighty-eight percent of the subjects were very satisfied with their treatment.A single session of DN treatment in the upper trapezius MTrPs combined with self-stretching exercises could greatly reduce pain between immediate post-procedure and 1 day after DN treatment.

Biomechanical Taping (BMT), a novel intervention, may provide equally effective management.This paper reports on the effectiveness of Biomechanical Taping compared with Kinesio Taping in improving shoulder pain, active range of motion (AROM), and function.Two groups of participants with TM were recruited through simple random sampling of participants from nine call centers and purposively-sampled participants from one fast-food chain and one community based rehabilitation center in Manila, Philippines. Participants were randomly allocated to either Kinesio Taping or biomechanical taping group in a double-blind clinical trial. Irrespective of the type of taping, participants performed gentle passive stretching of upper trapezius for six times each held for 30 s on Days 1, 3, and 5. On Days 2 and 4, participants performed gentle passive stretch of upper trapezius three times a day. Pre- and post-intervention measures were taken of Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity, AROM for shoulder movement, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand for function.Of 68 participants, 62 had shoulder symptoms secondary to TM. Similar significant within group improvements were found for Visual Analogue Scale scores, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand for biomechanical taping and Kinesio Taping interventions when comparing between group results (p < 0.05).Biomechanical Taping appears to be as effective as Kinesio Taping in the short term in decreasing pain and improving function of individuals with TM.

          "abstract": "Anatomical and in vivo studies suggest that muscles function synergistically as part of a myofascial chain. A related theory is that certain myofascial techniques have a remote and clinically important effect on range of motion (ROM).To determine if remote myofascial techniques can effectively increase the range of motion at a distant body segment.In November 2018, the authors searched 3 electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and PEDro) and hand-searched journals and conference proceedings. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials comparing remote myofascial techniques with passive intervention (rest/sham) or local treatment intervention. The primary outcome of interest was ROM. Quality assessment was performed using the PEDro Scale. Three authors independently evaluated study quality and extracted data. RevMan software was used to pool data using a fixed-effect model.Eight randomized controlled trials, comprising N = 354 participants were included (mean age range 22-36 y; 50% female). Study quality was low with PEDro scores ranging from 2 to 7 (median scores 4.5/10). None of the studies incorporated adequate allocation concealment and just 2 used blinded assessment of outcomes. In all studies, treatments and outcomes were developed around the same myofascial chain (superficial back line). Five studies included comparisons between remote interventions to sham or inactive controls; pooled results for ROM showed trends in favor of remote interventions (standard mean difference 0.23; 95% confidence intervals; -0.09 to 0.55; 4 studies) at immediate follow-ups. Effects sizes were small, corresponding to mean differences of 9% or 5° in cervical spine ROM, and 1 to 3 cm in sit and reach distance. Four studies compared remote interventions to local treatments, but there were few differences between groups.Remote exercise interventions may increase ROM at distant body segments. However, effect sizes are small and the current evidence base is limited by selection and measurement bias.",

Therefore, it is the purpose of this research study to compare the lower extremity muscle and upper extremity muscle activation patterns associated with the curveball pitch and the fastball pitch from the stretch position. Twelve skilled (NCAA collegiate level) pitchers volunteered to be in this study, with a mean age of 22.3 ± 4.53 years, mean height of 1.74 ± 0.13 m, and mean mass of 89.0 k ± 10.97 kg.

Each pitcher underwent maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) testing and then performed the fastball & curveball pitching sequence. All EMG variables of interest were normalized using MVIC data and compared between pitching type. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for all muscle activity as well. If significance was found a pairwise analysis (Bonferroni) was performed between pitch type, using SPSS (p 0.05). Significant differences in the mean muscle activity for the fastball and curveball pitched from the stretch were observed. A higher level of muscle activity was found for the stretch fastball when compared to the stretch curveball.

          "abstract": "The lumbar paraspinal muscle compartment (PMC) is a stabilizing system of the spine whose efficiency depends on its elastic properties, which may be quantifiable by supersonic shear wave elastography (SWE). The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) encapsulates the lumbar paraspinal muscles (LPM) and creates a PMC. Tensioning of the TLF via the stretching of the latissimus dorsi is supposed to increase stiffness within the PMC. The aims of this study were (1) to test the reliability of SWE in the multifidus and the erector spinae (ES) in prone and sited position; (2) to investigate the role of the tensioning of the pTLF, via stretching of the latissimus dorsi (LD), on LPM stiffness. Stiffness of ES and multifidus was measured using SWE at L3-L4 in procubitus and seated position in 15 participants. Stretching of LD was performed with arm elevation. Parametric paired tests, multiple analyses of variance, and intraclass correlation were used for statistical analysis. Reliability estimates were fair to excellent. Reliability was greater in ES than the multifidus, greater in seated position than during rest. Stiffness was greater in the ES than in multifidus, and in seated position than at rest. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not generate significant LPM stiffness changes. SWE is a reliable tool for assessing stiffness in the LPM. Reliability of SWE protocols is improved during seated position. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not influence LPM stiffness. Clin.

Despite evidence from in vitro studies, there is a dearth of literature concerning the in vivo behavior of these connections.To compare the effect of Static Stretching (SS) of hamstrings with remote Myofascial Release (MFR) (bilateral plantar fascia and suboccipital region) and a combination of SS and remote MFR on hamstring flexibility. The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the difference between therapist administered and self-administered interventions.Three arm assessor-blinded Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT).Fifty-eight asymptomatic participants (16 Males; Mean age 22.69 ± 2.65 years).Participants with tight hamstrings defined by a passive Knee Extension Angle (KEA) > 20° were included in the study and were assigned to one of the three groups. Group A (n = 19) was SS, group B (n = 20) was remote MFR, group C (n = 19) was a combination group who received both SS and remote MFR. Seven sessions of therapist administered intervention were delivered over a period of 10 days, which was followed by a 2-week self-administered home program. KEA and Sit and Reach Test (SRT) were used as outcomes and measurements were performed at baseline, end of the seventh session and after atwo-week follow-up.The results demonstrated that hamstring flexibility improved in all three groups after therapist administered interventions (p 0.05) change in the KEA with self-intervention.The findings of this study indicated that all three interventions were effective in improving hamstring flexibility in young asymptomatic individuals when performed by the therapist.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate thrust manipulation targeting the cervicothoracic junction compared to a manual stretch of the upper trapezius muscle on cervical range of motion and upper trapezius pressure pain thresholds (PPTs).Healthy participants with no significant history of neck pain were randomized into a thrust manipulation group, a stretching group, or a control group.

Recently, systematic review studies reported inconclusive effects of Botulinum toxin in myofascial pain management. The present study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Botulinum toxin type A (BTxA) (Botox®) injection for pain reduction in myofascial trigger point (MTrP) of the upper trapezius muscle.Thirty-three patients with 48 MTrP on the upper trapezius muscles over three months with moderate to severe pain intensity diagnosed at physical medicine and rehabilitation outpatient department were recruited between December 2011 and March 2012. Eligible patients were blinded and randomly injected with single 0.2 ml (20 IU) of BTxA for 24 MTrP and 0.2 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution for 24 MTrP at the most tender trigger point on the upper trapezius muscle. All patients were advised for stretching exercise and ergonomic adaptation throughout the study. At 3- and 6-week after injections, visual analogue scale (VAS), the pressure pain threshold (PPT), and reported adverse effects were measured.Both BTxA and control groups demonstrated statistically significant differences in VAS reduction and increased PPT after 3 weeks and 6 weeks compared with before treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in VAS reduction from baseline between the two groups at 3- and 6-week after treatment. A statistically significant difference in improvement of PPT from baseline and 6-week after BTxA injection compared with 0.9% NaCl group was shown (1.0 ± 0.9 and 0.5 ± 0.7, p = 0.036). There was mild degree side-effects that spontaneous resolved within one week in both groups without significant difference in percentage. No severe adverse effects were reported during the study.The efficacy in VAS reduction of a single 20 IU of Botulinum toxin type A (Botox®) injection was not different from 0.9% NaCl for myofascial trigger point at the upper trapezius muscle. However Botulinum toxin type A (Botox®) showed statistically significant more increased in pressure pain threshold at 6-week after injection without severe adverse effects.",

          "abstract": "This investigation was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of stretch-shortening cycling (SSC(EFF)) in upper-limb extensor muscles while cross-country skiing using the double-poling technique (DP). To this end, SSC(EFF) was analyzed in relation to DP velocity and performance. Eleven elite cross-country skiers performed an incremental test to determine maximal DP velocity (V(max)). Thereafter, cycle characteristics, elbow joint kinematics and poling forces were monitored on a treadmill while skiing at two sub-maximal and racing velocity (85% of V(max)). The average EMG activities of the triceps brachii and latissimus dorsi muscles were determined during the flexion and extension sub-phases of the poling cycle (EMG(FLEX), EMG(EXT)), as well as prior to pole plant (EMG(PRE)). SSC(EFF) was defined as the ratio of aEMG(FLEX) to aEMG(EXT). EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) increased with velocity for both muscles (P < 0.01), as did SSC(EFF) (from 0.9 ± 0.3 to 1.3 ± 0.5 for the triceps brachii and from 0.9 ± 0.4 to 1.5 ± 0.5 for the latissimus dorsi) and poling force (from 253 ± 33 to 290 ± 36N; P < 0.05). Furthermore, SSC(EFF) was positively correlated to Vmax, to EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) (P < 0.05). The neuromuscular adaptations made at higher velocities, when more poling force must be applied to the ground, exert a major influence on the DP performance of elite cross-country skiers.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we report the effect of manually stimulating the dorsal lumbosacral skin on spontaneous locomotor-like activity and on a variety of reflex responses in 5 decerebrate chronic spinal cats treated with clonidine. Cats were spinalized 1 month before the terminal experiment. Stretch reflexes were evoked by stretching the left triceps surae muscles. Crossed reflexes were elicited by electrically stimulating the right tibial or superficial peroneal nerves. Wind-up of reflex responses was evoked by electrically stimulating the left tibial or superficial peroneal nerves. We found that pinching the skin of the back abolished spontaneous locomotor-like activity. We also found that back pinch abolished the rhythmic activity observed during reflex testing without eliminating the reflex responses. Some of the rhythmic episodes of activity observed during reflex testing were consistent with clonus with an oscillation frequency greater than 3 Hz. Pinching the skin of the back effectively abolished rhythmic activity occurring spontaneously or evoked during reflex testing, irrespective of oscillation frequency. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that locomotion and clonus are produced by common central pattern-generators. Stimulating the skin of the back could prove helpful in managing undesired rhythmic activity in spinal cord-injured humans.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Kinesio tape was applied with 130-140% stretch to the rectus abdominis, internal oblique, erector spinae, and latissimus dorsi muscles, which are activated in the process of lifting.Following the KT application, the 'Visual Analog Scale' and 'Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores' gradually decreased and active trunk range of motion limited by the LBP increased progressively. The physical therapist no longer complained of LBP and was able to handle patients without any pain.Hence, continuous application of KT around the trunk may be a supplementary treatment method for acute LBP in physical therapists and enable continuous patient handling without any loss of work time due to occupational LBP.

Previous studies have suggested the usefulness of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) in the treatment of MPS since it is capable of controlling muscular spasms, as well as other alternative mechanisms of action.To analyze the efficacy of BTX-A treatment and its effect on daily life activities assessing pain reduction using a visual analogue scale (VAS); degree of improvement in physical impairment and disability scoring in the Oswestry low back pain questionnaire; and psychologic status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), in patients suffering from MPS.An open-label interventional prospective trial was conducted in 77 patients diagnosed of refractory MPS (defined as the presence of muscle spasm with pain on mobilization or stretching, plus the existence of trigger points with associated referred pain), resistant to both conservative management and to physical therapy. The BTX-A dosages for the different muscles were chosen according to a standardized protocol. Electromyographic guidance was used to localize the motor end plate prior to injection in superficial muscles; while fluoroscopic guidance was employed to evidence intramyofascial spread of the contrast solution within deep muscles. The assessment of treatment efficacy was based on a pain VAS applied before enrollment, at 15, 30, and 90 days and upon completion of the study; the Lattinen test to establish a relationship between pain intensity and its corresponding impact on daily living; and the HAD scale to assess psychologic stress, performed both before treatment and at the end of the study; and the Oswestry Questionnaire was used to evaluate patients' ability to carry out daily life activities according to their degree of physical impairment and disability scores.The global analysis revealed a positive correlation between the VAS score prior to treatment and the scoring at 15, 30, and 90 days. This correlation was maintained when analyzing independently for superficial or deep muscles. The correlation coefficients for HAD scores and the Lattinen test values showed a significant association between pre- and post-treatment findings. No adverse events were recorded for 83.1% of the cases.The results of this study are consistent with other studies showing the efficacy of BTX-A for treating pain in MPS.

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine how context and on-line sensory information are combined to control posture in seated subjects submitted to high-jerk, passive linear accelerations. Subjects were seated with eyes closed on a servo-controlled linear sled. They were asked to relax and received brief accelerations either sideways or in the fore-aft direction. The stimuli had an abrupt onset, comparable to the jerk experienced during a minor car collision. Rotation and translation of the head and body were measured using an Optotrak system. In some of the subjects, surface electromyographic (EMG) responses of selected neck and/or back muscles were recorded simultaneously. For each subject, responses were highly stereotyped from the first trial, and showed little sign of habituation or sensitisation. Comparable results were obtained with sideways and fore-aft accelerations. During each impulse, the head lagged behind the trunk for several tens of milliseconds. The subjects' head movement responses were distributed as a continuum in between two extreme categories. The 'stiff' subjects showed little rotation or translation of the head relative to the trunk for the whole duration of the impulse. In contrast, the 'floppy' subjects showed a large roll or pitch of the head relative to the trunk in the direction opposite to the sled movement. This response appeared as an exaggerated 'inertial' response to the impulse. Surface EMG recordings showed that most of the stiff subjects were not contracting their superficial neck or back muscles. We think they relied on bilateral contractions of their deep, axial musculature to keep the head-neck ensemble in line with the trunk during the movement. About half of the floppy subjects displayed reflex activation of the neck muscles on the side opposite to the direction of acceleration, which occurred before or during the head movement and tended to exaggerate it. The other floppy subjects seemed to rely on only the passive biomechanical properties of their head-neck ensemble to compensate for the perturbation. In our study, proprioception was the sole source of sensory information as long as the head did not move. We therefore presume that the EMG responses and head movements we observed were mainly triggered by the activation of stretch receptors in the hips, trunk and/or neck. The visualisation of an imaginary reference in space during sideways impulses significantly reduced the head roll exhibited by floppy subjects. This suggests that the adoption by the central nervous system of an extrinsic, 'allocentric' frame of reference instead of an intrinsic, 'egocentric' one may be instrumental for the selection of the stiff strategy. The response of floppy subjects appeared to be maladaptive and likely to increase the risk of whiplash injury during motor vehicle accidents. Evolution of postural control may not have taken into account the implications of passive, high-acceleration perturbations affecting seated subjects.",

          "abstract": "1. Both stretch and release of the ventral superficial muscles (VSM) in the abdomen of the hermit crab, Pagurus pollicarus, activate the VSM motoneurons in the intact animal and in the isolated abdomen. 2. This reflex was studied by recording intracellularly from muscle fibers innervated by single motoneurons during stretch and release of the VSM. The three motoneurons of the right fourth segment respond to both stretch and release with a phasic burst lasting approximately 250 ms. The burst in the two tonic motoneurons has two components, a short burst lasting 10-20 ms, with a latency from the beginning of stretch of 60-90 ms, and a longer burst of variable length, with a latency of 120 ms. Ramp stretches of different amplitudes and velocities were used to show that the first component is proportional to the absolute value of the second derivative of force and the second component to the absolute value of the first derivative of force. 3. Stretch and release of the VSM also simultaneously evoke phasic bursts in the motoneurons of the dorsal superficial muscles and the VSM circular muscles (functional antagonists of the longitudinal VSM), as well as in contralateral homologues of the same segment and in ipsilateral homologues of the next anterior segment. The effect of this coactivation is to stiffen the abdomen in response to perturbations in any direction. 4. Stretch or release of phasic mechanoreceptors in the VSM evokes this reflex. Isometric electrical stimulation of the isolated muscle also activates them, showing that they are transducing changes in force and suggesting that they operate to increase muscle stiffness by positive feedback. 5. A mathematical systems model of this reflex, composed of two parallel pathways activating the motoneurons, was constructed. The first pathway produces a signal proportional to the absolute value of the second derivative of force, the second pathway a signal proportional to the first derivative of force. The sum of the signals from the two pathways is filtered by an adaptation process, which is followed by a low-pass filter representing muscle activation kinetics. The muscle activation signal is then fed back to multiple muscle force. 6. Simulations using this model generate the phasic bursts to stretch and release as well as reproducing the frequency dependence of this reflex. The predominant action of this reflex is to enhance muscle stiffness.",

Total power for a 20-Kg dog was greatest for triceps at 0.77 watts (W) and least for rectus at 0.22 W; power per gram was greatest for gastrocnemius at 5.77 mW/g. Muscle perfusion of latissimus and rectus is greatly decreased by overstretching of the muscle. Overstretching also produces severe, persistent, power loss in latissimus and rectus muscles. Gastrocnemius and triceps tolerate stretching much better.

          "abstract": "1. The precentral bank of the Rolandic fissure of the cortical arm area has been explored with extracellular micro-electrodes in primates (baboons and monkeys) under nitrous oxide and oxygen anaesthesia, supplemented by small doses of Parkesernyl(R) and chloralose. The results in baboons and monkeys were the same.2. Single units were classified as pyramidal tract neurones or non-pyramidal tract neurones according to their antidromic responsiveness to stimuli applied in the dorsolateral funiculus at C1-2.3. Responses to electrical stimulation of the deep (motor) radial nerve, the deep palmar (motor) branch of the ulnar nerve, and the superficial (cutaneous) radial nerve could be recorded in the majority of neurones of the motor cortex provided that short trains of strong stimuli were used. Minimal responses to muscle nerve stimulation were observed in a few neurones at 1.4 x group I threshold, but most units reacted only with higher stimulus intensities (2-3 x group I threshold).4. The latencies to peripheral nerve stimulation were measured from the first peak of the incoming volley recorded at the root entry zone. The mean response latencies of pyramidal tract cells were between 20 and 25 msec; non-pyramidal tract cells were activated at slightly shorter mean latencies, the difference being significant for superficial radial nerve stimulation only (4 msec). These latencies are more than twice as long as those recorded in the postcentral gyrus, and the probability of discharge is lower than for postcentral neurones.5. A further difference between neurones of the postcentral and precentral gyrus is the pronounced convergence from different nerves and also from different modalities (cutaneous and muscle afferents) in units of the precentral cortex in contrast to units of the postcentral cortex.6. The high thresholds, necessary to activate precentral neurones by muscle nerve stimulation, make it unlikely that group I muscle afferents are involved. This is, furthermore, indicated by the lack of responsiveness to intravenous injection of succinylcholine which was, however, effective for driving neurones of the specific projection area for group I afferents, area 3a. The present experiments are consistent with the view that sensitivity of precentral neurones to muscle stretch (described in previous studies) is due to activation of secondary muscle spindle endings and their ascending pathways.7. The original hypothesis of a load compensating ;pyramidal reflex' with an oligosynaptic afferent contribution from the spindle primaries can be discarded. The present findings indicate that there is a feed-back from secondary muscle spindle afferents which, by way of a more complex pathway, can modulate the firing frequency of neurones in the motor cortex.",

          "abstract": "Biceps brachii muscle consists of a long head (BBL) and a short head (BBS). Shortening the BBL and BBS causes tendinopathy of the intertubercular groove and coracoid process. Therefore, it is necessary to stretch the BBL and BBS separately. This study aimed to determine the positions where the BBL and BBS were most stretched, using shear wave elastography (SWE). Fifteen healthy young males participated in the study. The shear elastic moduli of the BBL and BBS of the non-dominant arm were measured using SWE. The measurement positions were the resting position (shoulder flexion and abduction 0°) and four stretching positions.. The elbow was extended, and the forearm was pronated in all positions. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test to compare the shear elastic moduli between the resting and stretched limb positions. In addition, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used to compare shear elastic moduli between the stretching positions that were significantly different compared to the resting position.. Results show that for BBL and BBS, shear elastic moduli were significantly higher in the shoulder extension + external rotation and shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation positions than in the resting position. Moreover, the shear elastic modulus of the BBL was significantly higher in shoulder extension + external rotation than in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation. In contrast, the shear elastic modulus of the BBS was significantly higher in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation than in shoulder extension + external rotation.

          "abstract": "Neurotraumas or neurodegenerative diseases often result in proprioceptive deficits, which makes it challenging for the nervous system to adapt to the compromised sensorimotor conditions. Also, in human machine interactions, such as prosthesis control and teleoperation, proprioceptive mismatch limits accuracy and intuitiveness of controlling active joints in robotic agents. To address these proprioceptive deficits, several invasive and non-invasive approaches like vibration, electrical nerve stimulation, and skin stretch have been introduced. However, proprioceptive modulation is still challenging as the current solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness, usability, and consistency. In this paper, we propose a new way of modulating proprioception using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. We hypothesized that transcutaneous electrical stimulation on elbow flexor muscles will induce illusion of elbow joint extension.Eight healthy human subjects participated in the study to test the hypothesis. Transcutaneous electrodes were placed on different locations targeting elbow flexor muscles on human subjects and experiments were conducted to identify the best locations for electrode placement, and best electrical stimulation parameters, to maximize induced proprioceptive effect. Arm matching experiments and Pinocchio illusion test were performed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the observed effects. One-way repeated ANOVA test was performed on the data collected in arm matching experiment for statistical analysis.We identified the best location for transcutaneous electrodes to induce the proprioceptive illusion, as one electrode on the muscle belly of biceps brachii short head and the other on the distal myotendinous junction of brachioradialis. The results for arm-matching and Pinocchio illusion tests showed that transcutaneous electrical stimulation using identified electrode location and electrical stimulation parameters evoked the illusion of elbow joint extension for all eight subjects, which supports our hypothesis. On average, subjects reported 6.81° angular illusion of elbow joint extension in arm-matching tests and nose elongated to 1.78 × height in Pinocchio illusion test.Transcutaneous electrical stimulation, applied between the the synergistic elbow flexor muscles, consistently modulated elbow joint proprioception with the illusion of elbow joint extension, which has immense potential to be translated into various real-world applications, including neuroprosthesis, rehabilitation, teleoperation, mixed reality, and etc.",

The aims of the present study were two-fold: to experimentally determine the slack length of each head of the biceps brachii using elastography and to determine the influence of the length of biceps brachii on electromechanical delay and its electro-chemical/mechanical processes using very high frame rate ultrasound.First, 12 participants performed two passive stretches to evaluate the change in passive tension for each head of the biceps brachii. Then, they underwent two electrically evoked contractions from 120 to 20° of elbow flexion (0°: full extension), with the echographic probe maintained over the muscle belly and the myotendinous junction of biceps brachii. The slack length was found to occur at 95.5 ± 6.3° and 95.3 ± 8.2° of the elbow joint angle for the long and short heads of the biceps brachii, respectively. The electromechanical delay was significantly longer at 120° (16.9 ± 3.1 ms; p 0.95).In contrast to previous observations on gastrocnemius medialis, the onset of muscle motion and the onset of myotendinous junction motion occurred simultaneously regardless of the length of the biceps brachii.

Stretch reflex responses from the elbow extensors were analysed in seven healthy subjects for three head positions, two positions of the eyes and two initial EMG levels. At the opposite of the short latency stretch component (M1), the occurrence of the long-latency stretch responses (M2-3) did not depend on the EMG level. The head position influenced the EMG activity only for the lowest initial EMG level: a rotated head position towards the stretched extensor muscles increased the tonic EMG level of these muscles and facilitated the M2-3 component. This influence was modulated by the position of the eyes and occurred in both anconeus and triceps brachii recordings. These results support the hypothesis that a low EMG activity is needed to express TNR.

          "abstract": "1. Nine subjects received 6 baseline and 24 training sessions, each consisting of 250 elbow joint stretch perturbations into extension. The training sessions were designed to reduce the subjects' biceps brachii spinal stretch reflexes (SSR). Changes in longer-latency responses and short-latency brachioradialis responses were also monitored. Background electromyogram activity was recorded from the lateral head of triceps brachii during the biceps sampling intervals. These data were compared with those form 12 control subjects who received equal numbers of stretches over an extended baseline (i.e., without application of a training paradigm). 2. Training subjects reduced their mean biceps SSR responses by 24%, whereas control subjects increased their responses by 12% When changes in activity were grouped by sets of six consecutive sessions following the baseline interval, group-by-time interaction was observed. Training subjects showed significant reductions from baseline after the first raining set. The increased magnitude of biceps SSR for control subjects was significantly larger than baseline in sets 2-5. After the first training interval, all subsequent differences between groups were statistically significant. 3. The brachioradialis showed greater response variability, but these responses paralleled those seen in biceps brachii. The training group reduced their brachioradialis responses by 18%, whereas the control group increased their responses by 12%. Background activity recorded over the lateral head of triceps brachii during the biceps brachii SSR window became smaller in both groups. 4. Comparison of data between control subjects and subjects who had undergone biceps SSR up-training in previous studies suggests that the small increase seen among the present control subjects was probably not the result of a direct training effect. 5. Baseline differences in longer-latency response onset time were seen between groups. Over extended baseline sessions, longer-latency responses showed only a 1% onset, representing a change of 0.3 ms, in the control group. A 1.3% later onset, equaling a change of 1.1 ms, was observed over conditioning sessions in the training group. When analyzed by sets following baseline, neither group showed significant within- or between-group changes over time. 6. The magnitude of the longer-latency biceps brachii response showed 7% and 37% reductions for the control and training groups, respectively. No difference in set averages was seen within groups, but a significant difference was measured over sets 2-4 between groups. Reductions in the magnitude of longer-latency responses in training subjects were more obvious in later training sessions. 7. These data suggest that 1) the biceps brachii SSR can be reduced in human subjects; 2) concurrent changes are often observed in the synergist brachioradialis; and 3) the reduced biceps SSR magnitude is not linked to a compensatory increase in antagonist muscle activity. Reductions in the magnitude of longer-latency biceps brachii activity seen in parallel with the decreased SSR may imply that some degree of supraspinal processing is required to achieve this task.",

          "title": "A new approach of inducing proprioceptive illusion by transcutaneous electrical stimulation.",
          "abstract": "Neurotraumas or neurodegenerative diseases often result in proprioceptive deficits, which makes it challenging for the nervous system to adapt to the compromised sensorimotor conditions. Also, in human machine interactions, such as prosthesis control and teleoperation, proprioceptive mismatch limits accuracy and intuitiveness of controlling active joints in robotic agents. To address these proprioceptive deficits, several invasive and non-invasive approaches like vibration, electrical nerve stimulation, and skin stretch have been introduced. However, proprioceptive modulation is still challenging as the current solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness, usability, and consistency. In this paper, we propose a new way of modulating proprioception using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. We hypothesized that transcutaneous electrical stimulation on elbow flexor muscles will induce illusion of elbow joint extension.Eight healthy human subjects participated in the study to test the hypothesis. Transcutaneous electrodes were placed on different locations targeting elbow flexor muscles on human subjects and experiments were conducted to identify the best locations for electrode placement, and best electrical stimulation parameters, to maximize induced proprioceptive effect. Arm matching experiments and Pinocchio illusion test were performed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the observed effects. One-way repeated ANOVA test was performed on the data collected in arm matching experiment for statistical analysis.We identified the best location for transcutaneous electrodes to induce the proprioceptive illusion, as one electrode on the muscle belly of biceps brachii short head and the other on the distal myotendinous junction of brachioradialis. The results for arm-matching and Pinocchio illusion tests showed that transcutaneous electrical stimulation using identified electrode location and electrical stimulation parameters evoked the illusion of elbow joint extension for all eight subjects, which supports our hypothesis. On average, subjects reported 6.81° angular illusion of elbow joint extension in arm-matching tests and nose elongated to 1.78 × height in Pinocchio illusion test.Transcutaneous electrical stimulation, applied between the the synergistic elbow flexor muscles, consistently modulated elbow joint proprioception with the illusion of elbow joint extension, which has immense potential to be translated into various real-world applications, including neuroprosthesis, rehabilitation, teleoperation, mixed reality, and etc.",

The aims of the present study were two-fold: to experimentally determine the slack length of each head of the biceps brachii using elastography and to determine the influence of the length of biceps brachii on electromechanical delay and its electro-chemical/mechanical processes using very high frame rate ultrasound.First, 12 participants performed two passive stretches to evaluate the change in passive tension for each head of the biceps brachii. Then, they underwent two electrically evoked contractions from 120 to 20° of elbow flexion (0°: full extension), with the echographic probe maintained over the muscle belly and the myotendinous junction of biceps brachii. The slack length was found to occur at 95.5 ± 6.3° and 95.3 ± 8.2° of the elbow joint angle for the long and short heads of the biceps brachii, respectively. The electromechanical delay was significantly longer at 120° (16.9 ± 3.1 ms; p 0.95).In contrast to previous observations on gastrocnemius medialis, the onset of muscle motion and the onset of myotendinous junction motion occurred simultaneously regardless of the length of the biceps brachii.

          "abstract": "A 43-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to unstable walking, head tilting to the left and difficulty in extending his arm. He was quite healthy until the age of 20 years, when these symptoms appeared and progressed slowly afterward. Due to his unstable walking, he started to use a wheelchair when he was 39 years old. He had no family history of similar disease. On admission, neurological examination revealed spasmodic torticollis, ataxic speech and marked limb and truncal ataxia. Myoclonic jerky flexion of the forearm was induced when he raised and extended his forearm. He also showed mild hyperreflexia in the lower limbs without pathological reflexes. He had weakness and atrophy of the left supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid and biceps brachii muscles and mild superficial sensory impairment in the left axillary nerve territory due to cervical spondylotic radiculopathy of the left C5 root. MRI of the brain demonstrated severe bilateral atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis but minimal atrophy of the cerebrum and brainstem. Because surface electromyography revealed continuous discharge with phasic components in the biceps and wrist flexor muscles on extending the upper limbs, the jerky flexion movement of the forearm was considered to be primarily dystonia. Although no giant SEP was observed, a C-response was detected in the long-loop reflex in response to right median nerve stimulation. Nuclear examinations showed diffuse hypoperfusion and decreased glucose metabolism in the cerebellum. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that cerebellar dysfunction may have induced severe dystonic movement resembling myoclonus. We would like to name this complicated involuntary movement an \"arm thrust\". This is the first case to be reported of sporadic, chronic, progressive cerebellar ataxia accompanied by severe dystonic movement, especially on stretching the forearms, that mimics myoclonic movement.",

          "abstract": "This study was designed to test the influence of tonic neck reflexes (TNR) on the elbow extensor muscles. Surface electromyography (EMG) of triceps brachii (TB), anconeus (ANC) and biceps brachii (BB) muscles were recorded simultaneously with elbow acceleration. Stretch reflex responses from the elbow extensors were analysed in seven healthy subjects for three head positions, two positions of the eyes and two initial EMG levels. At the opposite of the short latency stretch component (M1), the occurrence of the long-latency stretch responses (M2-3) did not depend on the EMG level. The head position influenced the EMG activity only for the lowest initial EMG level: a rotated head position towards the stretched extensor muscles increased the tonic EMG level of these muscles and facilitated the M2-3 component. This influence was modulated by the position of the eyes and occurred in both anconeus and triceps brachii recordings. These results support the hypothesis that a low EMG activity is needed to express TNR. Changes in M2-3 with head position could result from the interaction of messages from limb afferents and neck afferents at a supraspinal level.",

          "abstract": "Biceps brachii muscle consists of a long head (BBL) and a short head (BBS). Shortening the BBL and BBS causes tendinopathy of the intertubercular groove and coracoid process. Therefore, it is necessary to stretch the BBL and BBS separately. This study aimed to determine the positions where the BBL and BBS were most stretched, using shear wave elastography (SWE). Fifteen healthy young males participated in the study. The shear elastic moduli of the BBL and BBS of the non-dominant arm were measured using SWE. The measurement positions were the resting position (shoulder flexion and abduction 0°) and four stretching positions.. The elbow was extended, and the forearm was pronated in all positions. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test to compare the shear elastic moduli between the resting and stretched limb positions. In addition, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used to compare shear elastic moduli between the stretching positions that were significantly different compared to the resting position.. Results show that for BBL and BBS, shear elastic moduli were significantly higher in the shoulder extension + external rotation and shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation positions than in the resting position. Moreover, the shear elastic modulus of the BBL was significantly higher in shoulder extension + external rotation than in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation. In contrast, the shear elastic modulus of the BBS was significantly higher in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation than in shoulder extension + external rotation.

The aim of this study was to establish the reliability of SWE in young children, define reference data on healthy ones and compare the shear modulus of healthy and spastic muscles from cerebral palsy (CP). The reproducibility is evaluated: at rest, on 7 children without any musculoskeletal pathology by 3 different operators, on 2 muscles: biceps brachii long head and medial gastrocnemius. The comparison study was made, on the same 2 muscles, at rest and under passive stretching, with a control group (29 healthy children), a spastic group (spastic muscles of 16 children from CP) and a non-spastic group (non-spastic muscles of 14 children from CP). The intra-operator reliability and inter-operator reliability, in terms of standard deviation, were 0.6 kPa (11.2% coefficient of variation (CV)) and 0.8 kPa (14.9% CV) for the biceps, respectively, and 0.4 kPa (11.5% CV) and 0.5 kPa (13.8% CV) for the gastrocnemius. At rest, no significant difference was found. Under passive stretching, the non-spastic CP biceps were significantly stiffer than the control ones (p = 0.033). Spastic gastrocnemius had a higher shear modulus than in the control muscles (p = 0.0003) or the non-spastic CP muscles (p = 0.017).

The hypothesis was that a bicipital pulley might remain intact, even in the case of a subscapularis tear.Between 2010 and 2011, all patients who had a primary arthroscopic repair of a subscapularis tear were potentially included in this prospective study. The outcome of interest was the prevalence and type of arthroscopic lesions of the LHBT and bicipital pulley. Furthermore, the supposed pathomechanics of injury and the treatment proposed (conservative, pulley repair, tenodesis, tenotomy, etc.) was recorded. The following baseline characteristics were assessed: age, sex, shoulder side, and limb dominance.Of the 218 patients, the superior glenohumeral ligament/coracohumeral ligament (SGHL/CHL) complex was normal in 54 patients (25%), stretched in 84 patients (39%), and absent in 77 patients (35%). Below the SGHL/CHL complex in the bicipital groove, the medial wall of the LHBT sheath was normal in 25%, partially torn in 39%, and completely torn in 35%. In 25 of the 218 patients (11%), a pathologic LHBT with an intact SGHL/CHL complex was observed. In these cases, the medial wall of the bicipital sheath was torn in 92%.The biceps pulley system, including the SGHL/CHL complex and subscapularis tendon, merits recognition as an important anatomical structure, and its lesions contribute to shoulder pathology. The subscapularis tendon is very important for the stability of the LHBT and should be included in the pulley system. In cases of a tear associated with a lesion of the SGHL/CHL complex, the LHBT is nearly always unstable and pathologic.II.",

          "abstract": "A 43-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to unstable walking, head tilting to the left and difficulty in extending his arm. He was quite healthy until the age of 20 years, when these symptoms appeared and progressed slowly afterward. Due to his unstable walking, he started to use a wheelchair when he was 39 years old. He had no family history of similar disease. On admission, neurological examination revealed spasmodic torticollis, ataxic speech and marked limb and truncal ataxia. Myoclonic jerky flexion of the forearm was induced when he raised and extended his forearm. He also showed mild hyperreflexia in the lower limbs without pathological reflexes. He had weakness and atrophy of the left supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid and biceps brachii muscles and mild superficial sensory impairment in the left axillary nerve territory due to cervical spondylotic radiculopathy of the left C5 root. MRI of the brain demonstrated severe bilateral atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis but minimal atrophy of the cerebrum and brainstem. Because surface electromyography revealed continuous discharge with phasic components in the biceps and wrist flexor muscles on extending the upper limbs, the jerky flexion movement of the forearm was considered to be primarily dystonia. Although no giant SEP was observed, a C-response was detected in the long-loop reflex in response to right median nerve stimulation. Nuclear examinations showed diffuse hypoperfusion and decreased glucose metabolism in the cerebellum. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that cerebellar dysfunction may have induced severe dystonic movement resembling myoclonus. We would like to name this complicated involuntary movement an \"arm thrust\". This is the first case to be reported of sporadic, chronic, progressive cerebellar ataxia accompanied by severe dystonic movement, especially on stretching the forearms, that mimics myoclonic movement.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate deep tendon reflex responses and associated electrophysiological parameters of the muscles in patients with fibromyalgia. This cross-sectional study included 38 patients with fibromyalgia and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Deep tendon reflexes of the rectus femoris and triceps brachii were tested using a reflex hammer. Electromyographic (amplitude and duration of activation), inertial measurement unit (angular velocity, acceleration), and electromechanical (delay) analyses were performed using a surface electromyography (sEMG) device. Comparative analyses were carried out between patients and controls. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of hyperreflexia in distinguishing fibromyalgia patients from controls. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the right/left rectus femoris and/or triceps brachii were observed in more than 85% (ranging from 86.8 to 94.7%) of the fibromyalgia group. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly increased deep tendon reflex responses compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients revealed significantly higher amplitude, longer duration of muscle activation, greater sagittal acceleration and angular velocity, and shorter electromechanical delay. Normalized muscle activation (right and left rectus femoris and right triceps brachii) in response to deep tendon reflex test showed acceptable ability in differentiating fibromyalgia patients from controls (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.890, 0.784 and 0.782, respectively). For the right rectus femoris, values ≤ 28.3 (clinically corresponding to normoactive/hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) appeared to rule-out fibromyalgia with 94.1% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibit increased deep tendon reflex responses. Normal or decreased deep tendon reflex responses may probably be used as a rule-out criterion for fibromyalgia.© 2025.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of lengthened partial repetitions (LPs) vs. full range of motion (ROM) resistance training (RT) on muscular adaptations.In this within-participant study, thirty healthy, resistance-trained participants had their upper extremities randomly assigned to either a lengthened partial or full ROM condition; all other training variables were equivalent between limbs. The RT intervention was an 8-week program targeting upper-body musculature. Training consisted of two training sessions per week, with four exercises per session and four sets per exercise. Muscle hypertrophy of the elbow flexors and elbow extensors was evaluated using B-mode ultrasonography at 45% and 55% of humeral length. Muscle strength-endurance was assessed using a 10-repetition-maximum test on the lat pulldown exercise, both with a partial and full ROM. Data analysis employed a Bayesian framework with inferences made from posterior distributions and the strength of evidence for the existence of a difference through Bayes factors.Both muscle thickness and unilateral lat pulldown 10-repetition-maximum improvements were similar between the two conditions. Results were consistent across outcomes with point estimates close to zero, and Bayes factors (0.16 to 0.3) generally providing \"moderate\" support for the null hypothesis of equal improvement across interventions.Trainees seeking to maximize muscle size should likely emphasize the stretched position, either by using a full ROM or LPs during upper-body resistance training.

In addition, electromyographic activities of the plantar flexor muscles (medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles) and oxygen consumption were measured during 5 min of submaximal repetitive jumps after both interventions (heating and control).Although no changes in tendon elongation at all force levels and elastic energy during ramp and ballistic contractions were observed, tendon hysteresis decreased by 14.2% during ramp contraction (p = 0.015 according to the paired t-test) and 8.0% during ballistic contraction (p = 0.006 according to the paired t-test) after heating. No changes in no-countermovement and countermovement jump heights were found after both interventions. The electromyographic activities of gastrocnemius muscles at the first half and soleus muscle at all time points were significantly lower for heating than for control conditions.

Three hamstring constituents were measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography. Skeletal muscle transcriptomes were compared across the genotypes of GWAS-identified variants in 48 healthy Japanese individuals. Association between GWAS-identified variants and history of muscle strain injury were examined in 1,428 Japanese athletes.Two loci on chromosome 11 demonstrated a genome-wide significant association with passive muscle stiffness of the biceps femoris long head (rs12807854 T/C: P = 5.19 × 10-10, rs78405694 T/C: P = 2.09 × 10-8; linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and stretching exercise habits). Skeletal muscle RNA sequencing revealed significantly elevated expression of extracellular matrix-related genes in muscles carrying stiffness-increasing alleles of these variants. Among athletes, rs12807854 T/C was significantly associated with a history of muscle strain injury (P = 0.0254; logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, competitive level, and main sport). Carriers of the C allele, associated with increased muscle stiffness, exhibited a heightened risk of muscle strain injury (odds ratio: 1.62; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.47 per C allele increase). In contrast, rs78405694 did not show a significant association with muscle strain injury in this population.A novel locus associated with passive muscle stiffness and muscle strain injury was identified.

          "abstract": "Human muscle tissue models are critical to understanding the complex physiology of skeletal muscle in studies of drug discovery, development, and toxicity profiling in the human body. However, due to the challenges in in vitro maturation of human muscle cells, few research groups developing their own tissue engineering techniques have succeeded in producing contractile human muscle tissues. Moreover, a more sophisticated method is necessary to measure contractile forces generated by the muscle tissues for preclinical studies in muscle physiology and drug discovery. Although a few research groups have established their own tissue model systems that measure contractile force, they require multi-step fabrication processes to produce human muscle tissues sufficiently functional to be able to measure the contractile forces. To improve the usability of our tissue model system, this study focused on simplifying the tissue engineering approach to produce a practical muscle tissue model. In this study, muscle satellite cells were simply mixed with a combination of fibrinogen, thrombin, and Matrigel before gel formation. The presence of muscle satellite cells induces gel compaction and spontaneously induces unidirectional stretching of the gel, resulting in the muscle satellite cells being aligned three-dimensionally with the direction of stretching. Furthermore, this gel environment promotes the maturation of the human muscle progenitor cells into aligned myofibers, also provides the tissue with an elastic platform for muscle contraction, and allows the attachment of the muscle tissue to a device for measurement of contractile force. Therefore, this one-step tissue fabrication allowed us to produce 3D-aligned human muscle tissues and this tissue model is ready to use for the measurement of contractile forces. In fact, the muscle contractions created by electrical and chemical stimulation were quantitatively determined using our measurement system. In addition, the impact of some representative drugs on this muscle tissue were able to be monitored in real-time throughout the changes in contractile forces. In conclusion, our tissue model system, produced by a simple fabrication method, can be used for preclinical in vitro studies in muscle physiology and drug discovery.© 2025 The Authors.",

Utilizing the self-alignment of nano-fillers in a polymeric matrix under repetitive tension, here, we introduce conductive carbon nanotubes with high aspect ratios into semi-crystalline polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels, and create electrically anisotropic percolation pathways through cyclic stretching. The resulting anisotropic hydrogel fibers (diameter of 187 ± 13 µm) exhibit fatigue resistance (up to 20,000 cycles at 20% strain) with a stretchability of 64.5 ± 7.9% and low electrochemical impedance (33.20 ± 9.27 kΩ @ 1 kHz in 1 cm length). We observe the reconstructed nanofillers' axial alignment and a corresponding anisotropic impedance decrease along the direction of cyclic stretching. We fabricate fiber-shaped hydrogels into bioelectronic devices and implant them into wild-type and transgenic Thy1::ChR2-EYFP mice to record electromyographic signals from muscles in anesthetized and freely moving conditions. These hydrogel fibers effectively enable the simultaneous recording of electrical signals from ventral spinal cord neurons and the tibialis anterior muscles during optogenetic stimulation. Importantly, the devices maintain functionality in intraspinal electrophysiology recordings over eight months after implantation, demonstrating their durability and potential for long-term monitoring in neurophysiological studies.© 2025.

          "abstract": "The effects of flywheel (FW) training on jump performance, muscle function, and muscle mass in athletes have not been fully clarified. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week FW training program on jump performance, stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function, muscle strength, peak power and muscle thickness in collegiate basketball players. Twenty male college basketball players (mean age: 19.8 ± 1.3 years, height: 179.1 ± 6.7 cm, body mass: 72.9 ± 6.3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the FW training (n = 11) or control group (n = 9). The FW training group performed squat exercises, 5 sets of 8 repetitions, twice a week using the FW device. Baseline and post-training assessments of jump heights of squat jumps (SJs), countermovement jumps (CMJs), and drop jumps (DJs) were performed in both groups. Additionally, the reactive strength index (RSI), representing SSC function; isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque during knee joint extension; peak power during squats; and quadriceps muscle thickness were evaluated. As the results, we observed that the FW training group demonstrated significant increases in post-training SJ height (15.1%, p = 0.03), DJ height (23.2%, p = 0.01), RSI (36.8%, p = 0.04), MVC, peak power and muscle thickness compared with pre-training levels. Furthermore, between-group comparisons indicated significantly higher post-training SJ height, DJ height, RSI, MVC, peak power, and muscle thickness in the FW training group (p < 0.05). Therefore, the FW training program effectively enhanced jump performance and SSC function in male basketball players and proved beneficial for muscle strength and hypertrophy.© 2025 The Author(s).

Sensors for detecting human motion and physiological signals have become a hot topic of current research. Inspired by the muscle fiber structure, this paper proposed a highly stable strain sensor that was composed of stretchable Spandex fibers (SPF), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and silicone rubber (Ecoflex). This sensor adopted an immersion coating process in which MWCNTs were conformally deposited on SPF, and Ecoflex was filled into the fiber interstices, completing the encapsulation and filling of the SPF to construct a stable three-dimensional conductive network. Thanks to the filling of Ecoflex, contact between conductive fibers during the stretching process was avoided, resulting in a significant change in the resistance. The sensitivity of the sensor reached 54.84, which is 10 times higher than before the Ecoflex filling with a stretchable strain range of up to 70%. The encapsulation of Ecoflex also prevented the detachment of MWCNTs on the fibers during stretching, improving the mechanical stability. The sensor can be easily attached to the surface of human skin to rapidly monitor various human motion signals. Furthermore, the sensor was related to the manipulator through wireless Bluetooth to realize the intelligent control of the manipulator. This work not only provided a more precise data monitoring method for medical and motion analysis fields but also offered an innovative solution for manipulator control.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(12): 2136-2146, 2024-The use of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC)-based measures of vertical jump performance to monitor responses to training exposures is common practice in sport science. However, evidence is limited with regards to which assessments and metrics may be most sensitive toward changes in training volume and intensity. The aim of this study was to investigate how a reduction in training volume, paralleled with an increase in training intensity, affects neuromuscular performance as measured through a countermovement jump (CMJ) and 10-5 hop test over a preseason period in female collegiate basketball players. Over a 3-week baseline period, athletes completed CMJ and 10-5 hop tests to quantify baseline performance. Measures of neuromuscular response to the changes in training volume and intensity were performed 2 and 4 days into the intervention week, as well as post 72 hours, post 7 days, and post 10 days. External workload data and descriptive analyses of resistance training stimuli suggest that during the intervention week, athletes experienced significantly lower training volumes and increases in training intensity. In response to these changes in training stimulus, athletes showed depressed performance acutely in metrics derived from both the CMJ and 10-5 hop test. Authors also observed a supercompensation effect at post 72 h, post one week, and post 2 weeks for metrics related to lower-limb stiffness and braking rate of force development. These findings highlight that in response to a high-intensity, low-volume training phase, female basketball players experienced alterations in lower-limb function, reflected in both decreases and increases in SSC performance.Copyright © 2024 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",

          "abstract": "Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2 (TRPV2) functions as a stretch-sensitive calcium channel, with overexpression in the sarcolemma of skeletal and cardiac myocytes leading to detrimental calcium influx and triggering muscle degeneration. In our previous pilot study, we showed that tranilast, a TRPV2 inhibitor, reduced brain natriuretic peptide levels in two patients with muscular dystrophy and advanced heart failure. Building on this, we performed a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study herein to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tranilast in the treatment of advanced heart failure in patients with muscular dystrophy.This study involved 18 patients with muscular dystrophy who had brain natriuretic peptide levels > 100 pg/mL, despite receiving standard cardioprotective therapy. Tranilast was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg three times daily. Over the short-term period (28 weeks), the primary endpoint of change ratio in the logarithm of brain natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 28 weeks was not significant in the full analysis set but was lower in the per set protocol compared with data from a previous beta-blocker treatment study. All 15 patients who completed the short-term treatment consented to be enrolled in long-term therapy for an additional 116 weeks. After all participants completed the long-term treatment, we analyzed all data. TRPV2 expression on the peripheral blood mononuclear cell surfaces decreased throughout the study period, confirming that the TRPV2 inhibitory effect of tranilast was maintained over time. Despite the presence of progressive disease, cardiac indices such as brain natriuretic peptide level, human atrial natriuretic peptide level, and fractional shortening, remained stable, and only brain natriuretic peptide levels at 144 weeks showed significant changes. The survival rate was 80.7%, and no cardiac deaths were reported. Regarding safety, no serious adverse events associated with tranilast were noted, except for recurrent diarrhea during the short-term period in one case.The findings suggest that tranilast can inhibit TRPV2 expression for an extended period and is effective in preventing the worsening of cardiac function and subsequent death from heart failure.The study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR: UMIN000031965, URL: http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ ) [March 30, 2018] and the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT, registration number: jRCTs031180038, URL: https://jrct.niph.go.jp/ ) [November 12, 2021].

          "abstract": "Humans can perform movements in various physical environments and positions (corresponding to different experienced gravity), requiring the interaction of the musculoskeletal system, the neural system and the external environment. The neural system is itself comprised of several interactive components, from the brain mainly conducting motor planning, to the spinal cord (SC) implementing its own motor control centres through sensory reflexes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether similar movements in various environmental dynamics necessitate adapting modulation at the brain level, correcting modulation at the spinal level, or both. Here, we addressed this question by focusing on upper limb motor control in various gravity conditions (magnitudes and directions) and using neuromusculoskeletal simulation tools. We integrated supraspinal sinusoidal commands with a modular SC model controlling a musculoskeletal model to reproduce various recorded arm trajectories (kinematics and EMGs) in different contexts. We first studied the role of various spinal pathways (such as stretch reflexes) in movement smoothness and robustness against perturbation. Then, we optimised the supraspinal sinusoidal commands without and with a fixed SC model including stretch reflexes to reproduce a target trajectory in various gravity conditions. Inversely, we fixed the supraspinal commands and optimised the spinal synaptic strengths in the different environments. In the first optimisation context, the presence of SC resulted in easier optimisation of the supraspinal commands (faster convergence, better performance). The main supraspinal commands modulation was found in the flexor sinusoid's amplitude, resp. frequency, to adapt to different gravity magnitudes, resp. directions. In the second optimisation context, the modulation of the spinal synaptic strengths also remarkably reproduced the target trajectory for the mild gravity changes. We highlighted that both strategies of modulation of the supraspinal commands or spinal stretch pathways can be used to control movements in different gravity environments. Our results thus support that the SC can assist gravity compensation.Copyright: © 2025 Bruel et al.

We hypothesize that selective diagnostic nerve block (DNB) of the tibial nerve motor branches can help identify which muscle is primarily responsible for clonus in patients with SEVF and provide useful information for botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) treatment. This retrospective study explored which calf muscles contributed to clonus in 91 patients with SEFV after stroke (n = 31), multiple sclerosis (n = 21), and cerebral palsy (n = 39), using selective DNB. We found that SEVF-associated clonus was most commonly driven by the soleus muscle, followed by the gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis, tibialis posterior, and flexor digitorum longus, and that frequency differed according to SEVF etiology. Our data suggest that identifying the muscles involved in SEVF-associated clonus may aid clinicians in personalizing BoNT-A treatment to single patients. Also, the findings of this study suggest that applying a 'stroke model' to treating spasticity secondary to other etiologies may not always be appropriate.",

          "abstract": "The optimum length for force generation (L0) increases as activation is reduced, challenging classic theories of muscle contraction. Although the activation dependence of L0 is seemingly consistent with length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity, this mechanism cannot explain the apparent force dependence of L0 or the effect of series compliance on activation-related shifts in L0. We have tested a theory proposing that the activation dependence of L0 relates to force depression resulting from shortening against series elasticity. This theory predicts that significant series compliance would cause tetanic L0 to be shorter than the length corresponding to optimal filament overlap, thereby increasing the activation dependence of L0. We tested this prediction by determining L0 and maximum tetanic force (P0) with (L0_spring, P0_spring) and without added compliance in bullfrog semitendinosus muscles. The activation dependence of L0 was characterized with the addition of twitch and doublet contractions. Springs attached to muscles gave added fixed-end compliances of 11%-39% and induced force depression for tetanic fixed-end contractions (P0_spring < P0). We found strong, negative correlations between spring compliance and both P0_spring (r2 = 0.89-0.91) and L0_spring (r2 = 0.60-0.63; P < 0.001), whereas the activation dependence of L0 was positively correlated to added compliance (r2 = 0.45, P = 0.011). However, since the compliance-mediated reduction in L0 was modest relative to the activation-related shift reported for the bullfrog plantaris muscle, additional factors must be considered. Our demonstration of force depression under novel conditions adds support to the involvement of a stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridge binding.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity does not fully explain the activation dependence of optimum length (L0). We demonstrate using an isolated muscle preparation and added series compliance that substantial force depression can arise during an isometric contraction, causing tetanic L0 to shift to a shorter length. Our findings illustrate that series compliance, via the work and length dependencies of force depression, partially uncouples force generation from myofilament overlap, which ultimately increases the activation (or force) dependence of L0.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Yoga has been recommended as a complementary management strategy for women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP), but many women lack access to specialized yoga instruction for this indication, and few data are available to evaluate changes in CPP with yoga. This feasibility trial evaluated the acceptability and tolerability of a remotely delivered yoga program for CPP in women and examined data quality and interpretability for measures of pelvic pain intensity and impact with yoga instruction. Methods: Ambulatory women with CPP were recruited from northern California in 2020-2022 and randomly assigned to a 2-month program involving twice weekly group classes delivered by videoconference supplemented by individual practice of pelvic yoga techniques versus a control program involving equivalent-time instruction and practice of nonspecific skeletal muscle stretching-strengthening exercises. Diaries, questionnaires, and in-class observations assessed intervention adherence and self-efficacy as well as CPP intensity and impact. Results: Among the 36 participants randomized (aged 27-77 years), the average (±standard deviation) baseline pelvic pain intensity was 4.2 (±2.0) (0-10 scale). Thirty-one (86%) completed the 2-month intervention programs, and 27 (75%) attended more than 85% of intervention classes. Among participants completing the yoga program (N = 16), 14 (87%) reported being at least moderately confident about performing all yoga postures after 2 months. Thirty (83%) provided pain intensity data at 2 months. Average pelvic pain intensity \"at its worst\" and \"on average\" were 1.9 (±1.6) and 1.1 (±1.4) points lower, respectively, after 2 months in this yoga group. Yoga participants also reported improvements in scores in the emotional, occupational, and psychological domains of the Impact of Female Chronic Pelvic Pain Questionnaire. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of a videoconference-based yoga program and collection of pain-related data among women with CPP, paving the way for future research to rigorously evaluate its specific efficacy in representative samples of women.

          "abstract": "Voltage-sensitive calcium channels contribute to depolarization of both motor neurons and interneurons in animal studies, but less is known of their contribution to human motor control and whether blocking them has potential in future antispasmodic treatment in humans. Therefore, this study investigated the acute effect of nimodipine on the transmission of human spinal reflex pathways involved in spasticity. In a double-blinded, crossover study, we measured soleus muscle stretch reflexes and H reflexes and tibialis anterior cutaneous reflexes in 19 healthy subjects before and after nimodipine (tablet 60 mg) or baclofen (tablet 25 mg). Baclofen was used as a control to compare nimodipine's effects with known antispastic treatment. Changes in the size of the maximum H reflex (Hmax)/maximum direct motor response in muscle (Mmax) ratio and stretch and cutaneous reflexes following intervention with nimodipine and baclofen, respectively, were analyzed with a one-way repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA. Nimodipine significantly reduced the Hmax/Mmax ratio [F(2.5,42) = 15; P < 0.0001] and the normalized soleus stretch reflex [F(2.6,47) = 4.8; P = 0.0073] after administration. A similar tendency was seen after baclofen [Hmax/Mmax ratio: F(2.1,39) = 4.0, P = 0.024; normalized stretch reflex: F(2.8,50) = 2.4; P = 0.083]. The Mmax response was unaffected by either intervention. Interestingly, during voluntary soleus activation, the stretch reflex remained unchanged with either treatment. For the cutaneous reflexes, there was a trend toward reduced early inhibition [F(1.6,9.3) = 4.5; P = 0.050] and subsequent facilitation [F(1.3,8.0) = 4.3; P = 0.065] after nimodipine. No severe adverse effects were reported after nimodipine. These findings suggest that nimodipine acutely reduced electrophysiological measures related to spasticity in healthy individuals. The effect seemed located at the spinal level, and voluntary contraction counterbalanced the reduction of the stretch reflex, highlighting its relevance for future studies on antispastic therapies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The calcium channel antagonist nimodipine significantly reduces the size of the soleus H reflex and stretch reflex in healthy individuals without affecting maximum direct motor response (Mmax) or the stretch reflex during voluntary activation.

          "abstract": "Residual force enhancement (rFE) and residual force depression (rFD) are history-dependent properties of muscle which refer to increased and decreased isometric force following a lengthening or shortening contraction, respectively. The history dependence of force is greater in older than in younger human adults when assessed at the joint level. However, it is unclear whether this amplification of the history dependence of force in old age is owing to cellular mechanisms or is a consequence of age-related remodelling of muscle architecture. Single muscle fibres from the psoas major of old and young F344BN rats were dissected and chemically permeabilized. Single muscle fibres were mounted between a force transducer and length controller, then maximally activated (pCa 4.5). To assess rFD, fibres were actively shortened from 3.1 to 2.5 µm at both a slow (0.15 Lo s-1) and fast (0.6 Lo s-1) speed, with a fixed-end isometric reference contraction at 2.5 µm. To assess rFE, fibres were activated and stretched at 0.3 Lo s-1 from a sarcomere length of 2.2 to 2.5 µm, and 2.7 to 3.0 µm, and compared with fixed-end isometric reference contractions at 2.5 and 3.0 µm, respectively. Isometric force (2.5 µm) was ∼19% lower in muscle fibres from old as compared with young rats (P 0.05). rFD was ∼33% greater in muscle fibres from old as compared with young rats (P 0.05). rFD is amplified in old age at the cellular level, while rFE appears to be unchanged; thus, previously reported age-related modification of rFE occurs upstream from the cellular level.© 2025.

We report that the RFE state is structurally distinct from pure isometric contractions, with increased thick filament strain and decreased lattice spacing, most likely caused by elevated titin-based forces. Furthermore, no RFE structural state was detected in mdm muscle. We posit that decreased lattice spacing, increased thick filament stiffness, and increased non-cross-bridge forces are the major contributors to RFE.

          "abstract": "During the shortening of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs), muscle force output is enhanced compared with pure shortening (SHO), referred to as the SSC-effect. In general, muscle-tendon unit (MTU), muscle belly, muscle fascicle, and tendon length changes can be decoupled during contraction, which affects force generation and elastic recoil. We researched whether MTU decoupling contributes to the SSC-effect. Participants performed electrically stimulated submaximal fixed-end, SSC, and SHO plantar-flexions on a dynamometer at two velocities (40, 120°/s) and two ranges of motion (15, 25°). Fascicle and tendon length changes of the gastrocnemius medialis, and ankle joint kinematics were assessed by ultrasound and motion capture, respectively. During SSC shortening, ankle joint torque and work, MTU force and work, and fascicle force were increased by 12%-22% compared with SHO, confirming a SSC-effect. Further, fascicle length change and velocity during SSCs were significantly reduced compared with SHO condition, and SSC fascicle work was decreased by ~35%. Our results indicate that MTU decoupling leads to a reduction in fascicle shortening amplitude and velocity, thereby increasing the muscle's force capacity while reducing its work output during SSC shortening. MTU decoupling therefore contributes to the SSC-effect and underlines the limited transferability of joint work measurements to estimated muscle work.© 2024 The Author(s).

Still, only a few previous studies have evaluated the chronic effects of an SS intervention program in older adults, and the potential relationship between ROM changes and muscle stiffness changes is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 10- week SS intervention partially supervised program on joint range of motion (ROM) and tissue hardness in older adults.The SS intervention program was conducted at least three times a week for 10 weeks in the ankle plantar flexor muscles of 24 community-dwelling older adults (73.8 ± 5.1 years; height: 156.0 ± 6.8 cm; body mass: 52.7 ± 8.0 kg). The SS intervention program consisted of 4 × 30-s repetitions. Ankle joint dorsiflexion (DF) ROM and tissue hardness of the medial gastrocnemius were measured before and after the 10-week SS intervention program.The results showed that the 10-week SS intervention program significantly increased DF ROM (+9°, p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 1.37) and decreased tissue hardness (-0.9, p = 0.04, Cohen's d = -0.27). However, there was no significant correlation between these changes (r = 0.086, p = 0.561).

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of arousal state and stretch speed on healthy individuals ROMmax, stiffness, gastrocnemius medialis, and soleus electromyographic activity (EMG). Fourteen participants performed one familiarization and then one testing session on separate days in the laboratory. In the familiarization (Session 1), participants practiced fast (30°/s ankle dorsiflexion) and slow (5°/s) plantar flexor stretches on an isokinetic dynamometer with the knee extended. In the experimental session (Session 2), they performed two slow, then two fast, stretches under three randomized arousal conditions: control (no music), arousing, and relaxing music. Dorsiflexion ROMmax, ankle joint stiffness, muscle activity during stretch, mean heart rate, and perception of arousal were measured. Perception of arousal was greater in the arousing than relaxing condition (p = 0.001). ROMmax was greater during fast (69.1° ± 7.8°) than slow stretches (64.9° ± 10.8°; p = 0.002) with no effect of arousal. Stiffness and EMG were higher at faster speeds, with a significantly greater percentage of stiffness observed in the arousing than the other conditions during faster stretches (p = 0.04). ROMmax was greater at the faster stretch speed despite greater stiffness and muscle activities being produced during the stretch. Thus, despite reflexive muscle activity and viscosity being higher during faster stretches, a greater, not lesser, ROMmax was observed. Arousal state, at least when altered by music, did not seem to affect ROMmax but somewhat influenced stiffness in the faster stretches.© 2024 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

          "abstract": "The stretch reflex is a fundamental component of the motor system that orchestrates the coordinated muscle contractions underlying movement. At the heart of this process lie the muscle spindles (MS), specialized receptors finely attuned to fluctuations in tension within intrafusal muscle fibres. The tension variation in the MS triggers a series of neuronal events including an initial depolarization of sensory type Ia afferents that subsequently causes the activation of motoneurons within the spinal cord1,2. This neuronal cascade culminates in the execution of muscle contraction, underscoring a presumed closed-loop mechanism between the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. By contrast, here we report the discovery of a new population of macrophages with exclusive molecular and functional signatures within the MS that express the machinery for synthesizing and releasing glutamate. Using mouse intersectional genetics with optogenetics and electrophysiology, we show that activation of MS macrophages (MSMP) drives proprioceptive sensory neuron firing on a millisecond timescale. MSMP activate spinal circuits, motor neurons and muscles by means of a glutamate-dependent mechanism that excites the MS. Furthermore, MSMP respond to neural and muscle activation by increasing the expression of glutaminase, enabling them to convert the uptaken glutamine released by myocytes during muscle contraction into glutamate. Selective silencing or depletion of MSMP in hindlimb muscles disrupted the modulation of the stretch reflex for force generation and sensory feedback correction, impairing locomotor strategies in mice. Our results have identified a new cellular component, the MSMP, that directly regulates neural activity and muscle contraction. The glutamate-mediated signalling of MSMP and their dynamic response to sensory cues introduce a new dimension to our understanding of sensation and motor action, potentially offering innovative therapeutic approaches in conditions that affect sensorimotor function.© 2024.

There were 35 cases in the muscle and bone assessment model manipulation group, including 12 males and 23 females;The age was 27 to 48 years old with an average of (37.77±7.63) years old. The course of disease was 35 to 180 days with an average of (83.68±69.01) days. The patients were treated with manual therapy under the guidance of muscle and bone assessment model, twice a week for 4 weeks. There were 34 cases in the two step seven gimmick group including 12 males and 22 females;The age was 26 to 49 years old with an average of (37.59±7.43) years old;The course of disease was 40 to 175 days with an average of (82.15±68.87) days.

          "abstract": "Although supervised exercise therapy (SET) is a primary treatment for peripheral artery disease (PAD), the current literature is limited regarding the mechanisms contributing to increased walking distances, including how lower extremity muscle function is altered after SET. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SET on lower extremity muscle function during walking in patients with PAD.Twelve patients with PAD participated in a 6-month SET program consisting of three weekly exercise sessions (a total of 72 sessions) and adhered to the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) recommendations. Each session started with a 5 min warm-up of mild walking and static stretching of upper and lower body muscles, followed by 50 min of intermitted exercise on a treadmill, and then finished with 5 min of cool-down activities similar to the warm-up. Each patient walked across a 10 m pathway with reflective markers on their lower limbs twice: before (baseline) and after six months of participation in SET (post-exercise). Marker coordinates and ground reaction forces were recorded and imported to OpenSim software (version 4.0) for gait simulations. Muscle force, muscle power, and metabolic rate were estimated from OpenSim and compared between the baseline and post-exercise.The mean plantar flexor force was not altered after SET. However, individuals' plantar flexor muscles demonstrated improvements in force production (lateral gastrocnemius: 75-80% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.43; medial gastrocnemius: 65-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.71; soleus: 90-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.26). Furthermore, plantar flexor power increased (80-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.39) and this was attributed to increased power in the lateral gastrocnemius (80-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47), medial gastrocnemius (80-90% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.22-0.60), and soleus muscles (85-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.49). Similarly, other muscle groups (knee extensors, knee flexors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip extensors, and hip flexors) also exhibited force and power increases after SET. Additionally, force and power variances were significantly decreased in several muscle groups (plantar flexors, knee extensors, hip abductors, hip external rotators, hip extensors, and hip flexors). Total metabolic rate also increased during the stance period where muscle force and power were elevated after SET (early stance: 5-25%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.82; mid stance: 35-45%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47; late stance: 75-80%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.36).Our results suggest that from a biomechanics perspective, muscle functions during walking are improved in patients with PAD after SET; however, the improvements were generally small and were not reflected by all muscle groups.",

The effects of combining radiofrequency (RF) therapy with static stretching (SS) on hamstring tightness have not been investigated.

The participants were allocated to the RF (intervention; n = 17) or sham (n = 16) group. The RF group underwent SS simultaneously with RF therapy. The sham group underwent SS with sham RF (powered off). The range of motion (ROM) for knee extension and five muscle properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation, and creep) of the lateral and medial hamstrings were measured before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in the ROM for knee extension (p = 0.295) between the RF and sham groups. The interaction between group and period (p > 0.05) was not significant for any of the muscle properties of the lateral and medial hamstrings besides lateral hamstring elasticity (p = 0.001).RF therapy in conjunction with SS for hamstring tightness produced different changes in muscle properties compared with SS alone. However, these changes did not produce differences in the ROM for knee extension.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The stretch of a patient with a complete tear of his left rectus femoris was recorded.The reaction force of the thigh was oriented at 33° (standard deviation [SD]: 6°) sideways and its intensity was 60 N m (SD: 19 N m). The centroid coordinates of all stretched structures were stable. The registered average external rotational torque of 6 N m (SD: 3.7 N m) could only be mediated by the FL. The stretched area indicated by the participants could be anywhere on the FL. The tolerated reaction force increased in the same way on the disinserted rectus femoris thigh and on the uninjured thigh.Ober's, Modified Thomas', and Ely's tests are three potential means of assessing FL extensibility. A lateral patellar tilt may be triggered by the FL's reaction force to stretching. Stretch tolerance seems to be limited by the FL, the fascia profundis of the thigh.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a neurodynamic stress test produces stiffness changes in the adjacent myotendinous complex.

Using Shear-Wave elastography, stiffness data were obtained for the ulnar nerve, flexor carpi ulnaris tendon and muscle before and after a neural tensioning maneuver.Following an ulnar nerve stretch, statistically significant differences were obtained in neural stiffness increase in nerve (p < 0.001), tendon (p < 0.001) and muscle (p = 0.046), with a moderate (d = 0.538), small (d = 0.485) and small (d = 0.224) effect sizes, respectively. The changes obtained were greater in those individuals with a smaller anatomical distance between nerve and tendon.Alterations in peripheral neural tissue tension involves elasticity changes in adjacent musculoskeletal tissue mediated by the neurovascular tract.

          "abstract": "The application of force is a key aspect of performance during athletic activities. In jumping, the timing and magnitude of force application are important performance factors. The relative timing of forces has only been investigated in the countermovement jump. This study aimed to explore if the synchronization of peak concentric force with the instance of zero velocity during a drop jump impacted performance and examine the relationship of force-time curve shape to performance. Sixty-six state-level athletes (24 males and 42 females) completed drop jumps from a 30 cm box onto dual force plates. The jump with the highest reactive strength index (RSI) score was taken for analysis and classified as synchronous or asynchronous based on the relative timing of peak concentric force and zero velocity. RSI and other force-time variables were compared between groups, and functional principal component analysis (fPCA) was performed on the force-time curves, which were used to perform functional principal component regression (fPCR). Synchronous jumpers exhibited greater RSI scores and shorter contact times compared to asynchronous jumpers. Performance differences were largely driven by improved concentric kinetics, which the fPCR model revealed to have the greatest influence on RSI. Sex was also found to be a significant factor for RSI in the fPCR model. fPCA revealed that greater force application preceding and throughout the amortization phase was positively associated with RSI. The timing of peak concentric force and the shape of the force-time curve are key factors for drop jump performance, and these concepts should be investigated further in other athletic activities.© 2024 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

KINVIS is a visually induced virtual kinesthetic perception that clinically suppresses spasticity. The present study hypothesized that central neural network activity during KINVIS affects subcortical neural circuits. The present study aimed to elucidate whether reciprocal and presynaptic inhibition occurs during KINVIS. Seventeen healthy participants were recruited (mean age: 27.9 ± 3.6 yr), and their soleus Hoffmann-reflexes (H-reflexes) were recorded by peripheral nerve stimulation while perceiving the dorsiflexion kinesthetic illusion in the right-side foot (seated in a comfortable chair). Two control conditions were set to observe the same foot video without the kinesthetic illusion while focusing on the static foot image. Unconditioned H-reflex and two types of conditioned H-reflexes were measured: Ia (reciprocal inhibition) and D1 (presynaptic inhibition). Reciprocal Ia and D1 inhibition of the soleus muscle was significantly enhanced during the kinesthetic illusion compared with the condition without kinesthetic illusion (a post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni test: Ia inhibition, P = 0.002; D1 inhibition, P = 0.049). This study indicates that kinesthetic illusion elicits an inhibitory effect on the monosynaptic reflex loop of Ia afferents, potentially inhibiting the hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. These findings demonstrate that brain activity associated with visually induced kinesthetic illusions acts on spinal inhibition circuits. These insights may be valuable in clinical rehabilitation practice, specifically for the treatment of spasticity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural effects in visual-induced kinesthetic illusion expand into the spinal reflex.

          "abstract": "Optimal loading involves the prescription of an exercise stimulus that promotes positive tissue adaptation, restoring function in patients undergoing rehabilitation and improving performance in healthy athletes. Implicit in optimal loading is the need to monitor the response to load, but what constitutes a normal response to loading? And does it differ among tissues (e.g., muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage) and systems? In this paper, we discuss the \"normal\" tissue response to loading schema and demonstrate the complex interaction among training intensity, volume, and frequency, as well as the impact of these training variables on the recovery of specific tissues and systems. Although the response to training stress follows a predictable time course, the recovery of individual tissues to training load (defined herein as the readiness to receive a similar training stimulus without deleterious local and/or systemic effects) varies markedly, with as little as 30 min (e.g., cartilage reformation after walking and running) or 72 h or longer (e.g., eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage) required between loading sessions of similar magnitude. Hyperhydrated and reactive tendons that have undergone high stretch-shorten cycle activity benefit from a 48-h refractory period before receiving a similar training dose. In contrast, bone cells desensitize quickly to repetitive loading, with almost all mechanosensitivity lost after as few as 20 loading cycles. To optimize loading, an additional dose (≤ 60 loading cycles) of bone-centric exercise (e.g., plyometrics) can be performed following a 4-8 h refractory period. Low-stress (i.e., predominantly aerobic) activity can be repeated following a short (≤ 24 h) refractory period, while greater recovery is needed (≥ 72 h) between repeated doses of high stress (i.e., predominantly anaerobic) activity. The response of specific tissues and systems to training load is complex; at any time, it is possible that practitioners may be optimally loading one tissue or system while suboptimally loading another. The consideration of recovery timeframes of different tissues and systems allows practitioners to determine the \"normal\" response to load. Importantly, we encourage practitioners to interpret training within an athlete monitoring framework that considers external and internal load, athlete-reported responses, and objective markers, to contextualize load-response data.© 2024.

          "abstract": "Emerging in vivo evidence suggests that repeated muscle contraction, or exercise, impacts peripheral nerves. However, the difficulty of isolating the muscle-specific impact on motor neurons in vivo, as well as the inability to decouple the biochemical and mechanical impacts of muscle contraction in this setting, motivates investigating this phenomenon in vitro. This study demonstrates that tuning the mechanical properties of fibrin enables longitudinal culture of highly contractile skeletal muscle monolayers, enabling functional characterization of and long-term secretome harvesting from exercised tissues. Motor neurons stimulated with exercised muscle-secreted factors significantly upregulate neurite outgrowth and migration, with an effect size dependent on muscle contraction intensity. Actuating magnetic microparticles embedded within fibrin hydrogels enable dynamically stretching motor neurons and non-invasively mimicking the mechanical effects of muscle contraction. Interestingly, axonogenesis is similarly upregulated in both mechanically and biochemically stimulated motor neurons, but RNA sequencing reveals different transcriptomic signatures between groups, with biochemical stimulation having a greater impact on cell signaling related to axonogenesis and synapse maturation. This study leverages actuating extracellular matrices to robustly validate a previously hypothesized role for muscle contraction in regulating motor neuron growth and maturation from the bottom-up through both mechanical and biochemical signaling.© 2024 The Author(s).

We hypothesize that selective diagnostic nerve block (DNB) of the tibial nerve motor branches can help identify which muscle is primarily responsible for clonus in patients with SEVF and provide useful information for botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) treatment. This retrospective study explored which calf muscles contributed to clonus in 91 patients with SEFV after stroke (n = 31), multiple sclerosis (n = 21), and cerebral palsy (n = 39), using selective DNB. We found that SEVF-associated clonus was most commonly driven by the soleus muscle, followed by the gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis, tibialis posterior, and flexor digitorum longus, and that frequency differed according to SEVF etiology. Our data suggest that identifying the muscles involved in SEVF-associated clonus may aid clinicians in personalizing BoNT-A treatment to single patients.

Chronological age and previous calf injury are the most substantial risk factors for MGS, including high body mass index, previous lower limb injuries, L5 radiculopathy, and inadequate warm-up. The dominant presentation of MGS is a pain that can be diverse from acute to latent, which is felt in the posteromedial aspect of the calf and is often preceded by a feeling of a pop. The signs of MGS include antalgic gait, ecchymosis, swelling, local tenderness, and sometimes a palpable gap felt along the muscle. Passive dorsiflexion of the ankle or resistive ankle plantarflexion with knee extension can indicate a more severe injury, while functional tests can illicit milder injuries of calf muscles-including gastrocnemius. The diagnosis of MGS is usually made by clinical evaluation. However, imaging modalities-including magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound-can be helpful in case of suspicion. In most cases of MGS, the cornerstone of treatment is nonoperative rehabilitation, which can be performed as a 4-phase program and should be tailored individually. Some instances of MGS are referred for early or later surgical treatment if indicated. In this article, we review the literature about various aspects of MGS, from diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, and propose a structured approach to this injury.© 2024 Iran University of Medical Sciences.",

          "abstract": "When recommending avoidance of static stretching prior to athletic performance, authors and practitioners commonly refer to available systematic reviews. However, effect sizes (ES) in previous reviews were extracted in major part from studies lacking control conditions and/or pre-post testing designs. Also, currently available reviews conducted calculations without accounting for multiple study outcomes, with ES: -0.03 to 0.10, which would commonly be classified as trivial.Since new meta-analytical software and controlled research articles have appeared since 2013, we revisited the available literatures and performed a multilevel meta-analysis using robust variance estimation of controlled pre-post trials to provide updated evidence. Furthermore, previous research described reduced electromyography activity-also attributable to fatiguing training routines-as being responsible for decreased subsequent performance. The second part of this study opposed stretching and alternative interventions sufficient to induce general fatigue to examine whether static stretching induces higher performance losses compared to other exercise routines.Including 83 studies with more than 400 ES from 2012 participants, our results indicate a significant, small ES for a static stretch-induced maximal strength loss (ES = -0.21, p = 0.003), with high magnitude ES (ES = -0.84, p = 0.004) for stretching durations ≥60 s per bout when compared to passive controls. When opposed to active controls, the maximal strength loss ranges between ES: -0.17 to -0.28, p < 0.001 and 0.040 with mostly no to small heterogeneity. However, stretching did not negatively influence athletic performance in general (when compared to both passive and active controls); in fact, a positive effect on subsequent jumping performance (ES = 0.15, p = 0.006) was found in adults.Regarding strength testing of isolated muscles (e.g., leg extensions or calf raises), our results confirm previous findings.

          "abstract": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the influence of a stretch intervention on the common modulation of discharge rate among motor units in the calf muscles during a submaximal isometric contraction. The current report comprises a computational analysis of a motor unit dataset that we published previously (Mazzo et al., 2021). Motor unit activity was recorded from the three main plantar flexor muscles while participants performed an isometric contraction at 10% of the maximal voluntary contraction force before and after each of two interventions. The interventions were a control task (standing balance) and static stretching of the plantar flexor muscles. A factorization analysis on the smoothed discharge rates of the motor units from all three muscles yielded three modes that were independent of the individual muscles. The composition of the modes was not changed by the standing-balance task, whereas the stretching exercise reduced the average correlation in the second mode and increased it in the third mode. A centroid analysis on the correlation values showed that most motor units were associated with two or three modes, which were presumed to indicate shared synaptic inputs. The percentage of motor units adjacent to the seven centroids changed after both interventions: Control intervention, mode 1 decreased and the shared mode 1 + 2 increased; stretch intervention, shared modes either decreased (1 + 2) or increased (1 + 3). These findings indicate that the neuromuscular adjustments during both interventions were sufficient to change the motor unit modes when the same task was performed after each intervention. KEY POINTS: Based on covariation of the discharge rates of motor units in the calf muscles during a submaximal isometric contraction, factor analysis was used to assign the correlated discharge trains to three motor unit modes. The motor unit modes were determined from the combined set of all identified motor units across the three muscles before and after each participant performed a control and a stretch intervention. The composition of the motor unit modes changed after the stretching exercise, but not after the control task (standing balance). A centroid analysis on the distribution of correlation values found that most motor units were associated with a shared centroid and this distribution, presumably reflecting shared synaptic input, changed after both interventions. Our results demonstrate how the distribution of multiple common synaptic inputs to the motor neurons innervating the plantar flexor muscles changes after a brief series of stretches.© 2024 The Authors.

          "abstract": "Due to Achilles tendon compliance, passive ankle stiffness is insufficient to stabilise the body when standing. This results in 'paradoxical' muscle movement, whereby calf muscles tend to shorten during forward body sway. Natural variation in stiffness may affect this movement. This may have consequences for postural control, with compliant ankles placing greater reliance upon active neural control rather than stretch reflexes. Previous research also suggests ageing reduces ankle stiffness, possibly contributing to reduced postural stability. Here we determine the relationship between ankle stiffness and calf muscle movement during standing, and whether this is associated with postural stability or age. Passive ankle stiffness was measured during quiet stance in 40 healthy volunteers ranging from 18 to 88 years of age. Medial gastrocnemius muscle length was also recorded using ultrasound. We found a significant inverse relationship between ankle stiffness and paradoxical muscle movement, that is, more compliant ankles were associated with greater muscle shortening during forward sway (r ≥ 0.33). This was seen during both quiet stance as well as voluntary sway. However, we found no significant effects of age upon stiffness, paradoxical motion or postural sway. Furthermore, neither paradoxical muscle motion nor ankle stiffness was associated with postural sway. These results show that natural variation in ankle stiffness alters the extent of paradoxical calf muscle movement during stance. However, the absence of a clear relationship to postural sway suggests that neural control mechanisms are more than capable of compensating for a lack of inherent joint stiffness.© 2024 The Authors.

We aimed to examine the acute effects of different exercise ROM resistance training on the plantar flexor muscles. Eighteen healthy untrained male adults participated in three conditions: calf raises in 1) partial condition [final (short muscle length) partial ROM], 2) full condition (full ROM), and 3) control condition. The ankle dorsiflexion (DF) ROM, passive torque at DF ROM, passive stiffness of muscle-tendon unit, and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC-ISO) torque were measured before and immediately after the interventions. There were significant increases in DF ROM, passive torque at DF ROM, and a decrease in MVC-ISO, but no significant interaction in passive stiffness. Post hoc test, DF ROM demonstrated moderate magnitude increases in the full condition compared to the partial (p = 0.023, d = 0.74) and control (p = 0.003, d = 0.71) conditions. Passive torque at DF ROM also showed moderate magnitude increases in the full condition compared to the control condition (p = 0.016, d = 0.69). MVC-ISO had a moderate magnitude decrease in the full condition compared to the control condition (p = 0.018, d=-0.53). Resistance training in the full ROM acutely increases joint ROM to a greater extent than final partial ROM, most likely due to stretch tolerance.",

The FAIR (flexion adduction internal rotation) test is a provocation test used to identify sciatic nerve irritation caused by this muscle. Compression and stretching exercises are usually prescribed to treat this syndrome. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of these two treatments on surface electromyography (sEMG) of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior in patients with low back pain (LBP) and DGS.Forty-five participants were allocated to three groups of stretching exercise, compression or control. In addition to 15 min of heat and 15 min of electrical nerve stimulation for pain relief, participants in the compression exercise (CE) group received self-compression exercise, those in the stretching exercise (SE) group received self-stretching exercise and those in the control group received no extra interventions. For the two intervention groups, three sets of two minutes of exercise with two minutes of rest in between were applied. The sEMG amplitude values of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles of the affected buttock side of any one group while performing the FAIR test were compared to the others. Pain and disability were assessed and the changes were compared between the two groups.After the intervention period, no group demonstrated a change in the sEMG of the gastrocnemius or tibialis anterior muscles (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the change in this variable between groups (Mean difference (95% CI) of gastrocnemius was ranged over= -4.04 to 7.72 (-19.44 to 23.14); p = 0.603); (Mean difference (95% CI) of tibialis anterior muscles was ranged from - 2.44 to -6.43 (-18.28 to 9.31); p = 0.550).; Pain and disability also decreased significantly in all three study groups (p < 0.05). However, only the disability of patients who performed stretching exercises improved compared to the compression exercise group (Mean difference (95% CI) = -12.62 (-20.41 to -4.38); p = 0.009).Neither stretching nor compression exercises altered the sEMG of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles in patients with DGS.

Video footage was obtained and three raters independently categorised injury mechanism and situational patterns using a standardised checklist. Injury epidemiology (month), timing of injuries within the match and location of injuries on the pitch were also examined.We identified 121 lower limb severe muscle injuries. Videos of sufficient quality were available for 103 (85%) cases, including 61 (60%) hamstring, 17 (16%) calf, 16 (15%) adductor and 9 (9%) quadricep muscle injuries. Nearly two-thirds of injuries involved the dominant/kicking leg (n=65, 63%). Eighty-five (83%) injuries were non-contact and 18 (17%) indirect contact. Four main situational patterns were identified and accounted for 88% of injuries: (1) running/acceleration (n=35, 34%); (2) closed kinetic chain stretching (n=21, 20%); (3) open kinetic chain stretching (n=19, 18%) and (4) kicking (n=16, 16%), with differences between muscle groups. 71% of injuries occurred in the first half of the match (p<0.01), with a gradual increase through the first half.Most severe muscle injuries during football matches were non-contact and occurred in the first half during running/acceleration, open and closed kinetic chain stretching, or kicking.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

We hypothesized that preexercise PS would provide better vascular resilience after treadmill exercise. Sixteen healthy college-aged males and females participated in a single laboratory visit and underwent testing to assess micro- and macrovascular function. Participants were randomized into either PS group or sham control group. Intermittent calf PS was performed by having the foot in a splinting device for a 5-min stretch and 5-min relaxation, repeated four times. Then, a staged V̇o2 peak test was performed and 65% V̇o2 peak calculated for subjects to run at for 30 min.

          "abstract": "Maximal strength measured via maximal voluntary contraction is known as a key factor in competitive sports performance as well as injury risk reduction and rehabilitation. Maximal strength and hypertrophy are commonly trained by performing resistance training programs. However, literature shows that long-term, long-lasting static stretching interventions can also produce significant improvements in maximal voluntary contraction. The aim of this study is to compare increases in maximal voluntary contraction, muscle thickness and flexibility after 6 weeks of stretch training and conventional hypertrophy training. Sixty-nine (69) active participants (f = 30, m = 39; age 27.4 ± 4.4 years, height 175.8 ± 2.1 cm, and weight 79.5 ± 5.9 kg) were divided into three groups: IG1 stretched the plantar flexors continuously for one hour per day, IG2 performed hypertrophy training for the plantar flexors (5 × 10-12 reps, three days per week), while CG did not undergo any intervention. Maximal voluntary contraction, muscle thickness, pennation angle and flexibility were the dependent variables. The results of a series of two-way ANOVAs show significant interaction effects (p < 0.05) for maximal voluntary contraction (ƞ2 = 0.143-0.32, p < 0.006), muscle thickness (ƞ2 = 0.11-0.14, p < 0.021), pennation angle (ƞ2 = 0.002-0.08, p = 0.077-0.625) and flexibility (ƞ2 = 0.089-0.21, p < 0.046) for both the stretch and hypertrophy training group without significant differences (p = 0.37-0.99, d = 0.03-0.4) between both intervention groups. Thus, it can be hypothesized that mechanical tension plays a crucial role in improving maximal voluntary contraction and muscle thickness irrespective whether long-lasting stretching or hypertrophy training is used. Results show that for the calf muscle, the use of long-lasting stretching interventions can be deemed an alternative to conventional resistance training if the aim is to increase maximal voluntary contraction, muscle thickness and flexibility. However, the practical application seems to be strongly limited as a weekly stretching duration of up to 7 h a week is opposed by 3 × 15 min of common resistance training.© 2023. The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "A recent in-vivo experiment has shown that force can be transmitted between the gastrocnemius and the hamstring muscles due to a direct tissue continuity. However, it remains unclear if this mechanical interaction is affected by the stiffness of the structural connection. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of the knee angle on myofascial force transmission across the dorsal knee. A randomized, cross-over study was performed, including n = 56 healthy participants (25.36 ± 3.9 years, 25 females). On two separate days, they adopted a prone position on an isokinetic dynamometer (knee extended or 60° flexed). In each condition, the device moved the ankle three times from maximal plantarflexion to maximal dorsal extension. Muscle inactivity was ensured using EMG. High-resolution ultrasound videos of the semimembranosus (SM) and the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) soft tissue were recorded. Maximal horizontal tissue displacement, obtained using cross-correlation, was examined as a surrogate of force transmission. SM tissue displacement was higher at extended (4.83 ± 2.04 mm) than at flexed knees (3.81 ± 2.36 mm). Linear regression demonstrated significant associations between (1) SM and GM soft tissue displacement (extended: R2 = 0.18, p = 0.001; flexed: R2 = 0.17, p = 0.002) as well as (2) SM soft tissue displacement and ankle range of motion (extended: R2 = 0.103, p = 0.017; flexed: R2 = 0.095, p = 0.022).

          "abstract": "Spasticity, i.e. stretch hyperreflexia, increases joint resistance similar to symptoms like hypertonia and contractures. Botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A) injections are a widely used intervention to reduce spasticity. BoNT-A effects on spasticity are poorly understood, because clinical measures, e.g. modified Ashworth scale (MAS), cannot differentiate between the symptoms affecting joint resistance. This paper distinguishes the contributions of the reflexive and intrinsic pathways to ankle joint hyper-resistance for participants treated with BoNT-A injections. We hypothesized that the overall joint resistance and reflexive contribution decrease 6 weeks after injection, while returning close to baseline after 12 weeks.Nine participants with spasticity after spinal cord injury or after stroke were evaluated across three sessions: 0, 6 and 12 weeks after BoNT-A injection in the calf muscles. Evaluation included clinical measures (MAS, Tardieu Scale) and motorized instrumented assessment using the instrumented spasticity test (SPAT) and parallel-cascade (PC) system identification. Assessments included measures for: (1) overall resistance from MAS and fast velocity SPAT; (2) reflexive resistance contribution from Tardieu Scale, difference between fast and slow velocity SPAT and PC reflexive gain; and (3) intrinsic resistance contribution from slow velocity SPAT and PC intrinsic stiffness/damping.Individually, the hypothesized BoNT-A effect, the combination of a reduced resistance (week 6) and return towards baseline (week 12), was observed in the MAS (5 participants), fast velocity SPAT (2 participants), Tardieu Scale (2 participants), SPAT (1 participant) and reflexive gain (4 participants). On group-level, the hypothesis was only confirmed for the MAS, which showed a significant resistance reduction at week 6. All instrumented measures were strongly correlated when quantifying the same resistance contribution.At group-level, the expected joint resistance reduction due to BoNT-A injections was only observed in the MAS (overall resistance). This observed reduction could not be attributed to an unambiguous group-level reduction of the reflexive resistance contribution, as no instrumented measure confirmed the hypothesis. Validity of the instrumented measures was supported through a strong association between different assessment methods. Therefore, further quantification of the individual contributions to joint resistance changes using instrumented measures across a large sample size are essential to understand the heterogeneous response to BoNT-A injections.© 2023.

          "abstract": "Introduction: If the aim is to increase maximal strength (MSt) and muscle mass, resistance training (RT) is primarily used to achieve these outcomes. However, research indicates that long-duration stretching sessions of up to 2 h per day can also provide sufficient stimuli to induce muscle growth. In RT literature, sex-related differences in adaptations are widely discussed, however, there is a lack of evidence addressing the sex-related effects on MSt and muscle thickness (MTh) of longer duration stretch training. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of 6 weeks of daily (1 h) unilateral static stretch training of the plantar flexors using a calf-muscle stretching device. Methods: Fifty-five healthy (m = 28, f = 27), active participants joined the study. MSt and range of motion (ROM) were measured with extended and flexed knee joint, and MTh was investigated in the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. Results: Statistically significant increases in MSt of 6%-15% (p < .001-.049, d = 0.45-1.09), ROM of 6%-21% (p < .001-.037, d = 0.47-1.38) and MTh of 4%-14% (p < .001-.005, d = 0.46-0.72) from pre-to post-test were observed, considering both sexes and both legs. Furthermore, there was a significant higher increase in MSt, MTh and ROM in male participants. In both groups, participants showed more pronounced adaptations in MSt and ROM with an extended knee joint as well as MTh in the medial head of the gastrocnemius (p < .001-.047). Results for relative MSt increases showed a similar result (p < .001-.036, d = 0.48-1.03). Discussion: Results are in accordance with previous studies pointing out significant increases of MSt, MTh and ROM due to long duration static stretch training. Both sexes showed significant increases in listed parameters however, male participants showed superior increases.Copyright © 2023 Warneke, Zech, Wagner, Konrad, Nakamura, Keiner, Schoenfeld and Behm.",

Passive torque at submaximal dorsiflexion angles was significantly decreased only after combined trial (all p < 0.05).

          "abstract": "Increased muscle stiffness can result in a reduced range of motion (ROM) and impaired function. An increased ankle injury risk has been associated with reduced ankle dorsiflexion ROM. Although self-myofascial release (SMFR) is commonly used in clinical and sporting settings, little is known about its impact on gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon (AT) stiffness. As a result, we investigated how SMFR using a foam roller (FR) affects gastrocnemius-AT complex stiffness and ankle dorsiflexion ROM. According to these results, self-myofascial relaxation of the gastrocnemius and an improvement in ankle dorsiflexion ROM can be accomplished by rolling an FR along the calf. Myofascial release (MFR) is a type of manual therapy that involves stretching the myofascial complex with a light load and for a long duration in order to restore optimal length, relieve pain, and improve function.

          "abstract": "Connective tissue links the skeletal muscles, creating a body-wide network of continuity. A recent in-vivo experiment demonstrated that passive elongation of the calf caused a caudal displacement of the semimembranosus muscle, indicating force transmission across the dorsal knee joint. However, it remains unclear as to whether this observation is dependent on the joint angle. If force would not be transmitted at flexed knees, this would reduce the number of postures and movements where force transmission is of relevance. Our trial, therefore, aims to investigate the influence of passive calf stretching with the knee in extended and flexed position on dorsal thigh soft tissue displacement.Participants are positioned prone on an isokinetic dynamometer. The device performs three repetitions of moving the ankle passively (5°/s) between plantar flexion and maximum dorsiflexion. With a washout-period of 24 hours, this procedure is performed twice in randomised order, once with the knee extended (0°) and once with the knee flexed (60°). Two high-resolution ultrasound devices will be used to visualize the soft tissue of the calf and dorsal thigh during the manoeuvre. Maximal horizontal displacement of the soft tissue [mm] during ankle movement will be quantified as a surrogate of force transmission, using a frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis of the obtained US videos.Understanding myofascial force transmission under in-vivo conditions is a pre-requisite for the development of exercise interventions specifically targeting the fascial connective tissue. Our study may thus provide health and fitness professional with the anatomical and functional basis for program design.The study is registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (TRN: DRKS00024420), registered 8 Februar 2021, https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00024420.",

A total of thirty participants were randomly assigned into two groups, and twenty-eight completed the intervention. In both groups, participants participated in three experimental trials (SS2, SS4, and SS8) on 3 days. 2-minute intermittent stretching (SS2) was performed on day-I, 4-minute (SS4) on day II, and 8-minute (SS8) on day III. Isometric MVCF was measured at pre-intervention, 0-, 10-, and 20-minute post-intervention periods in both groups.In the proximal group: SS2, SS4, and SS8 did not affect isometric MVCF at the 0-, 10-, and 20-minute post-intervention periods (P > .05).

          "abstract": "Rebuilding strength capacity is of crucial importance in rehabilitation since significant atrophy due to immobilization after injury and/or surgery can be assumed. To increase maximal strength (MSt), strength training is commonly used. The literature regarding animal studies show that long-lasting static stretching (LStr) interventions can also produce significant improvements in MSt with a dose-response relationship, with stretching times ranging from 30 min to 24 h per day; however, there is limited evidence in human studies. Consequently, the aim of this study is to investigate the dose-response relationship of long-lasting static stretching on MSt. A total of 70 active participants (f = 30, m = 39; age: 27.4 ± 4.4 years; height: 175.8 ± 2.1 cm; and weight: 79.5 ± 5.9 kg) were divided into three groups: IG1 and IG2 both performed unilateral stretching continuously for one (IG1) or two hours (IG2), respectively, per day for six weeks, while the CG served as the non-intervened control. MSt was determined in the plantar flexors in the intervened as well as in the non-intervened control leg to investigate the contralateral force transfer. Two-way ANOVA showed significant interaction effects for MSt in the intervened leg (ƞ2 = 0.325, p < 0.001) and in the contralateral control leg (ƞ2 = 0.123, p = 0.009), dependent upon stretching time. From this, it can be hypothesized that stretching duration had an influence on MSt increases, but both durations were sufficient to induce significant enhancements in MSt. Thus, possible applications in rehabilitation can be assumed, e.g., if no strength training can be performed, atrophy could instead be reduced by performing long-lasting static stretch training.",

It is considered to be an easy and safe method for achieving good results5-7.PMGR is performed with the patient in the prone position. A thigh tourniquet is not utilized. We prefer to use spinal anesthesia, but local anesthesia could be applied along with sedation. A posteromedial incision is made on or just below the posterior knee crease. The crural fascia is divided, and the proximal insertion of the medial gastrocnemius is identified. Performing the \"hook maneuver\" with a curved dissector is helpful at this step. Only the white fibers are sectioned in order to allow for a lengthening of the muscular fibers that is completed with forceful ankle dorsiflexion. After proper hemostasis has been achieved, the subcutaneous layer and skin are closed, leaving the fascia open.Nonoperative treatment should be the first option, including analgesics, insoles, heel cups, calf-stretching, injections, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy8. Some authors have also suggested that application of a walking cast for 3 to 6 weeks should be attempted9,10. Once all of these treatment options have failed, operative treatment is appropriate. Historically, open plantar fasciotomy was offered to patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis, and this treatment continues to be a surgical option. Other procedure, like the Strayer, Vulpius, or Baumann techniques, involve the calf system and are called \"gastrocnemius recession.\" However, these techniques act in the more distal aspect of the calf system compared with PMGR.PMGR offers patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis rapid recovery and good results. This procedure obviates the complications associated with plantar fasciotomy, in which the medial aspect of the proximal plantar fascia is divided to relieve the overload. A plantar fasciotomy (either open or endoscopic11) risks lateral column overload12 or a painful flatfoot if >50% of the fascia is divided. A long recovery period following plantar fasciotomy has also been described7. On the other hand, other procedures have been utilized to lengthen the Achilles-calcaneus-plantar system to an even greater extent. Techniques like the Silfverskiöld (i.e., medial and lateral proximal gastrocnemius release) or Strayer (i.e., division of the distal aspect of the gastrocnemius fascia) technique present a higher rate of complications (up to 38%), specifically nerve injuries13,14. We consider these procedures (classified as gastrocnemius recession procedures) more properly indicated for patients with neurological diseases or with an equinus contracture. The medial gastrocnemius is the more powerful of the 2 bellies. Releasing the medial head alone offers a robust decrease in tension and is safer than approaching the lateral head of the gastrocnemius15. At the same time, this technique provides a quick recovery for the patient. PMGR can also help those patients with other clinical signs related to gastrocnemius tightness, such as calf cramps and pain or repeated muscle injuries. Moreover, it can be effective in patients with second-rocker metatarsalgia or midportion Achilles tendinitis1,16.PMGR has a reported rate of satisfaction of >80%. Most patients undergoing this procedure experience substantial pain relief within the first 2 to 3 months6,17. PMGR is an outpatient procedure with a short operative time and a rapid return to recreational and labor activities. The complication rate is low, and the most common complications are calf hematomas and delayed wound healing. The present article demonstrates a reduction in pain and good functional results. An improvement in the perception of health-related quality of life, especially in the physical and pain domains of the Short Form-36 questionnaire, was also observed.The prone position allows for direct access to the proximal medial head of the gastrocnemius. Preferably, perform PMGR without a tourniquet in order to assure proper hemostasis. Keep the ankle joint free at the end of operating table because ankle dorsiflexion is a helpful maneuver at some stages in this procedure. Digital (index finger) dissection should be performed among the medial head of the gastrocnemius, the hamstrings, and the posterior aspect of the proximal tibia. The hook maneuver, performed with use of a blunt dissector, is helpful to identify all of the white fibers. Only white fibers should be divided. The surgeon must also make sure to cut the more anterior part of the aponeurosis that is hidden by red fibers. After cutting the white fibers, forceful ankle dorsiflexion is required to obtain full lengthening of the muscle. Proper hemostasis should be achieved to prevent formation of a calf hematoma.

          "abstract": "Self-massage using foam rollers, sticks, or balls has become a popular technique to enhance joint range of motion (ROM). Although increases are reported to be larger in females than males, the mechanisms of this observation are unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of roller massage (RM) on ROM, passive tissue stiffness, and neurophysiological markers as a function of sex. Males (n = 15, 22.8 ± 2.9 yrs.) and females (n = 14, 21.1 ± 0.7 yrs.) performed three 60-second bouts of calf RM. Outcomes assessed pre-, and post-intervention included passive dorsiflexion (DF) ROM, passive tissue stiffness, passive torque, DF angle at the first stretch sensation, shear elastic modulus, and spinal excitability. DF ROM (+35.9 %), passive torque at DF ROM (+46.4 %), DF angle at first stretch sensation (+32.9 %), and pain pressure threshold (+25.2 %) increased in both groups (p 0.05). No changes were observed for passive stiffness, shear elastic modulus, and spinal excitability (p > 0.05). Roller massage may increase ROM independently of sex, which, in the present study, could not be ascribed to alterations in passive stiffness or neurophysiological markers. Future studies may further elucidate the role of sensory alterations as possible factors driving RM-induced changes in flexibility.© Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",

In Experiment 1, the changes in cardiac output, the shear rate in the posterior tibial artery, and blood volume in the calf muscle were measured during recovery (0-60 s) from a single bout of one-legged passive calf stretching in 12 healthy young men. In Experiment 2, the effects of different relaxation periods (5-, 10-, 20-, and 60-s) of passive one-legged intermittent calf stretching (30-s × 6 sets) on the femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (faPWV) as an index of peripheral arterial stiffness were identified in 17 healthy young men. As a result, the stretched leg's shear rate significantly increased from 0 to 10th s after stretching. The muscle blood volume in the stretched leg significantly reduced during stretching, and then significantly increased during the recovery period after stretching; however, cardiac output remained unchanged during stretching and recovery. Additionally, the reduction in faPWV from the pre-stretching value in the stretched leg was significantly larger in the protocol with 10-s and 20-s relaxation periods than that in the non-stretched leg, but this did not differ in the 5-s and 60-s relaxation periods.

          "abstract": "As hyperactive muscle stretch reflexes hinder movement in patients with central nervous system disorders, they are a common target of treatment. To improve treatment evaluation, hyperactive reflexes should be assessed during activities as walking rather than passively. This study systematically explores the feasibility, reliability and validity of sudden treadmill perturbations to evoke and quantify calf muscle stretch reflexes during walking in children with neurological disorders.We performed an observational cross-sectional study including 24 children with cerebral palsy (CP; 6-16 years) and 14 typically developing children (TD; 6-15 years). Short belt accelerations were applied at three different intensities while children walked at comfortable speed. Lower leg kinematics, musculo-tendon lengthening and velocity, muscle activity and spatiotemporal parameters were measured to analyze perturbation responses.We first demonstrated protocol feasibility: the protocol was completed by all but three children who ceased participation due to fatigue. All remaining children were able to maintain their gait pattern during perturbation trials without anticipatory adaptations in ankle kinematics, spatiotemporal parameters and muscle activity. Second, we showed the protocol's reliability: there was no systematic change in muscle response over time (P = 0.21-0.54) and a bootstrapping procedure indicated sufficient number of perturbations, as the last perturbation repetition only reduced variability by ~ 2%. Third, we evaluated construct validity by showing that responses comply with neurophysiological criteria for stretch reflexes: perturbations superimposed calf muscle lengthening (P < 0.001 for both CP and TD) in all but one participant. This elicited increased calf muscle activity (359 ± 190% for CP and 231 ± 68% for TD, both P < 0.001) in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle, which increased with perturbation intensity (P < 0.001), according to the velocity-dependent nature of stretch reflexes. Finally, construct validity was shown from a clinical perspective: stretch reflexes were 1.7 times higher for CP than TD for the gastrocnemius medialis muscle (P = 0.017).The feasibility and reliability of the protocol, as well as the construct validity-shown by the exaggerated velocity-dependent nature of the measured responses-strongly support the use of treadmill perturbations to quantify stretch hyperreflexia during gait.

The influence of these stretch-induced changes on muscle function at submaximal forces is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the changes in neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles after a static-stretch intervention were estimated. Neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles during a low-force contraction increased after repeated static stretches. These findings suggest that adjustments in motor unit activity are necessary at low forces to accommodate reductions in the force-generating and transmission capabilities of the muscle-tendon unit after repeated static stretches of the calf muscles.Static stretching decreases stiffness about a joint, but its influence on muscle-tendon unit function and muscle activation is unclear. We investigated the influence of three static stretches on changes in neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles, both after a stretch intervention and after a set of maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Estimates of neural drive were obtained during submaximal isometric contractions by decomposing high-density electromyographic signals into the activity of individual motor units from medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius and soleus. Motor units were matched across contractions and an estimate of neural drive to the plantar flexors was calculated by normalizing the cumulative spike train to the number of active motor units (normalized neural drive). Mean discharge rate increased after the stretch intervention during the 10% MVC task for all recorded motor units and those matched across conditions (all, P = 0.0046; matched only, P = 0.002), recruitment threshold decreased for motor units matched across contractions (P = 0.022), and discharge rate at recruitment was elevated (P = 0.004). Similarly, the estimate of normalized neural drive was significantly greater after the stretch intervention at 10% MVC torque (P = 0.029), but not at 35% MVC torque. The adjustments in motor unit activity required to complete the 10% MVC task after stretch may have been partially attenuated by a set of plantar flexor MVCs.

The KT was controlled in three tension intensities in a randomised order: paper-off, 50%, and 100% of maximal stretch tension of the tape. The peak-to-peak amplitude of maximal M-wave (Mmax) and H-reflex (Hmax) responses in the SOL, MG, and LG muscles were assessed before taping (pre-taping), taping, and after taping (post-taping) phases in the lying prone position. The results demonstrated significantly larger LG Hmax responses in the pre-taping condition than those in the post-taping condition during paper-off KT (p = 0.002). Moreover, the ΔHmax/Mmax of pre- and post-taping in the SOL muscle was significantly larger during 50%KT tension than that of paper-off (p = 0.046). In conclusion, the stretch tension of KT contributes minor influence on the spinal motoneuron excitability in the triceps surae during rest.",

          "abstract": "Despite the widespread occurrence of muscle cramps, their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. To better understand the etiology of muscle cramps, this study investigated acute effects of muscle cramping induced by maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on the amplitude of Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflex) and compound muscle action potentials (M-wave).Healthy men (n = 14) and women (n = 3) participated in two identical sessions separated by 7 days. Calf muscle cramping was induced by performing MVIC of the plantar flexors in a prone position followed by 2.5-s NMES over the plantar flexors with increasing frequency and intensity. H-reflexes and M-waves evoked by tibial nerve stimulation in gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and soleus were recorded at baseline, and after MVIC-induced cramps and the NMES protocol.Six participants cramped after MVIC, and H-reflex amplitude decreased in GM and soleus in Session 1 (- 33 ± 32%, - 34 ± 33%, p = 0.031) with a similar trend in Session 2 (5 cramped, p = 0.063), whereas the maximum M-wave was unchanged. After NMES, 11 (Session 1) and 9 (Session 2) participants cramped. H-reflex and M-wave recruitment curves shifted to the left in both sessions and muscles after NMES independent of cramping (p ≤ 0.001).Changes in H-reflexes after a muscle cramp induced by MVIC and NMES were inconsistent. While MVIC-induced muscle cramps reduced H-reflex amplitude, muscle stretch to end cramping was a potential contributing factor. By contrast, NMES may potentiate H-reflexes and obscure cramp-related changes. Thus, the challenge for future studies is to separate the neural consequences of cramping from methodology-based effects.",

          "abstract": "Ankle proprioception is crucial for balance and relies upon accurate input from calf muscle spindles. Spindle input, in turn, depends upon the physiological and mechanical properties of surrounding muscle tissue. Altering these properties could affect ankle proprioception, with potential consequences for balance. Here we determine the effects of prior muscle cooling, stretch and contraction upon performance of a contralateral ankle joint matching task. Participants stood passively leaning against a board oriented 22° rearward from vertical. Their right ankle was rotated to a randomised position between ± 6° plantar/dorsiflexion. The task was to align the left ankle to the same position, without vision. In the first experiment, immediately prior to each testing session, participants either produced a strong calf muscle contraction in a fully plantarflexed (tiptoe) posture or underwent 15° dorsiflexion stretch. Contraction had no effect on task performance, whereas stretch produced a significant bias in ankle placement of 0.89 ± 0.6°, indicating that participants perceived their foot to be more plantarflexed compared to a control condition. In the second experiment, the right lower leg was cooled in iced water (≤ 5°C) for 10 minutes. Cooling increased joint matching error by ~0.4°, through a combination of increased bias and variability. These results confirm that conditioning the triceps surae muscles can alter perception of ankle joint position. Since body movement during quiet stance is in the order of 1°, the magnitude of these changes are relevant for balance.",

Recently, vibration foam rolling (VFR) has emerged. Its underlying concept is that it combines foam rolling techniques with local vibration to improve ROM and muscular activation concurrently. This crossover study investigated the effects of DS or DS followed by VFR (DS + VFR) during warm-ups on flexibility, muscle stiffness, power, and agility of the lower limbs in badminton athletes. Forty badminton players performed DS or DS + VFR as warm-up exercises on two occasions in a randomized order. The target muscle groups were the bilateral shoulder, anterior and posterior thigh, posterior calf, and lower back. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was knee range of motion (ROM), and the secondary outcomes were muscle stiffness, lower limb power (countermovement jump [CMJ]), and agility. Results indicated that the protocols improved performance. DS increased knee flexion ROM (% change = 1.92, ES = 0.3, p = 0.033), CMJ height (% change = 5.04, ES = 0.2, p = 0.004), and agility (% change = -4.97, ES = 0.4, p < 0.001) but increased quadriceps muscle stiffness (% change = 3.74, ES = 0.3, p = 0.001) and increased gastrocnemius muscle stiffness (% change = 10.39, ES = 0.5, p = 0.001). DS + VFR increased knee extension ROM (% change =2.87, ES = 0.4, p = 0.003), reduced quadriceps muscle stiffness (% change = -2.79, ES = 0.3, p = 0.017), CMJ height (% change = 2.41, ES = 0.1, p = 0.037), and agility (% change = -4.74, ES = 0.2, p < 0.001). DS + VFR was not significantly superior to DS, except for muscle stiffness reduction. Taken together, we suggest that practitioners consider DS as a first line of warm-up exercise to increase ROM, CMJ height, and agility in athletes. Moreover, the addition of VFR to DS results in a large reduction of muscle stiffness, potentially reducing the risk of sports injury.

Currently, it is unknown if the order an individual performs FR and SS influences flexibility or whether flexibility is retained. This study aimed to determine if FR before, or, following SS influences passive hip flexion range of motion (ROM), and if changes are retained.Between-group experimental design.Thirty-five participants with less than 90° of passive hip flexion ROM volunteered. Over 8 days, 6 days separated by 24 hours, and then 1 week (day 7) and 2 weeks (day 8) following the last treatment, ROM was measured before and following 1 of 5 treatments; FR/SS, SS/FR, SS, FR, or nothing (control). Participants laid supine on a table where a bubble inclinometer was placed on the tibia of the dominant leg with the hip passively flexed to establish pretreatment ROM. Participants then received the treatments. Passive hip flexion ROM was assessed from pretreatment on day 1 to posttreatment on day 6, day 7 (1 wk), and day 8 (2 wk).Passive hip flexion ROM increased for those receiving FR/SS, SS/FR, FR, and SS. ROM with FR and SS/FR was retained at day 7 but not day 8. Hip flexion ROM for FR/SS and SS were not retained at day 7 nor 8. SS/FR resulted in greater ROM than FR on day 6. SS/FR, FR/SS, SS, and FR were greater than the control at day 6. SS/FR was also greater than the control on days 7 and 8.This study revealed that FR the hamstring muscles after SS produces the greatest gains in passive hip flexion and would be appropriate in noninjured patients with less than 90°.",

Therefore, our objectives were to estimate the effect of neurodynamic techniques on HF and to compare the effect of these techniques with static stretching.We systematically searched the Cochrane, MEDLINE(via PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science and Sportdiscus databases for RCTs comparing neurodynamic interventions with control intervention or with static stretching exercises for HF in adults with limited HF. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup analyses according to the type of comparison group(control group or static stretching exercises) and total number of sessions.

          "abstract": "We aimed to screen the entire genome for genetic variants associated with passive muscle stiffness, which has been suggested as a risk factor for muscle strain injury.This genome-wide association study (GWAS) on passive muscle stiffness included 350 physically active young Japanese individuals. Three hamstring constituents were measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography. Skeletal muscle transcriptomes were compared across the genotypes of GWAS-identified variants in 48 healthy Japanese individuals. Association between GWAS-identified variants and history of muscle strain injury were examined in 1,428 Japanese athletes.Two loci on chromosome 11 demonstrated a genome-wide significant association with passive muscle stiffness of the biceps femoris long head (rs12807854 T/C: P = 5.19 × 10-10, rs78405694 T/C: P = 2.09 × 10-8; linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and stretching exercise habits). Skeletal muscle RNA sequencing revealed significantly elevated expression of extracellular matrix-related genes in muscles carrying stiffness-increasing alleles of these variants. Among athletes, rs12807854 T/C was significantly associated with a history of muscle strain injury (P = 0.0254; logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, competitive level, and main sport). Carriers of the C allele, associated with increased muscle stiffness, exhibited a heightened risk of muscle strain injury (odds ratio: 1.62; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.47 per C allele increase). In contrast, rs78405694 did not show a significant association with muscle strain injury in this population.A novel locus associated with passive muscle stiffness and muscle strain injury was identified. Elucidating the detailed mechanisms linking the identified locus to passive muscle stiffness may lead to the development of new strategies to prevent muscle strain injuries.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

          "title": "Does force depression resulting from shortening against series elasticity contribute to the activation dependence of optimum length?",
          "abstract": "The optimum length for force generation (L0) increases as activation is reduced, challenging classic theories of muscle contraction. Although the activation dependence of L0 is seemingly consistent with length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity, this mechanism cannot explain the apparent force dependence of L0 or the effect of series compliance on activation-related shifts in L0. We have tested a theory proposing that the activation dependence of L0 relates to force depression resulting from shortening against series elasticity. This theory predicts that significant series compliance would cause tetanic L0 to be shorter than the length corresponding to optimal filament overlap, thereby increasing the activation dependence of L0. We tested this prediction by determining L0 and maximum tetanic force (P0) with (L0_spring, P0_spring) and without added compliance in bullfrog semitendinosus muscles. The activation dependence of L0 was characterized with the addition of twitch and doublet contractions. Springs attached to muscles gave added fixed-end compliances of 11%-39% and induced force depression for tetanic fixed-end contractions (P0_spring < P0). We found strong, negative correlations between spring compliance and both P0_spring (r2 = 0.89-0.91) and L0_spring (r2 = 0.60-0.63; P < 0.001), whereas the activation dependence of L0 was positively correlated to added compliance (r2 = 0.45, P = 0.011). However, since the compliance-mediated reduction in L0 was modest relative to the activation-related shift reported for the bullfrog plantaris muscle, additional factors must be considered. Our demonstration of force depression under novel conditions adds support to the involvement of a stress-induced inhibition of cross-bridge binding.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity does not fully explain the activation dependence of optimum length (L0). We demonstrate using an isolated muscle preparation and added series compliance that substantial force depression can arise during an isometric contraction, causing tetanic L0 to shift to a shorter length. Our findings illustrate that series compliance, via the work and length dependencies of force depression, partially uncouples force generation from myofilament overlap, which ultimately increases the activation (or force) dependence of L0.",

The effects of combining radiofrequency (RF) therapy with static stretching (SS) on hamstring tightness have not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to verify the superiority of combining RF and SS over SS alone by comparing their immediate effects on hamstring flexibility.This randomized controlled study included 33 participants with hamstring tightness. The participants were allocated to the RF (intervention; n = 17) or sham (n = 16) group. The RF group underwent SS simultaneously with RF therapy. The sham group underwent SS with sham RF (powered off). The range of motion (ROM) for knee extension and five muscle properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation, and creep) of the lateral and medial hamstrings were measured before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in the ROM for knee extension (p = 0.295) between the RF and sham groups. The interaction between group and period (p > 0.05) was not significant for any of the muscle properties of the lateral and medial hamstrings besides lateral hamstring elasticity (p = 0.001).RF therapy in conjunction with SS for hamstring tightness produced different changes in muscle properties compared with SS alone.

Following a 48-h washout period, the interventions were swapped between the respective groups. Both groups underwent assessments averaging three countermovement vertical jumps (CVJ) with hands on hips and three VJ with arms free.

          "abstract": "Background/Objective: Short hamstring syndrome is common in the general population and can lead to impaired balance, function, and posture, and increased risk of injuries. Local treatments have obtained controversial results, so it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of other types of therapy such as osteopathic treatment. To evaluate the efficacy of osteopathic techniques in increasing the elasticity of the hamstring musculature in short hamstring syndrome. Methods: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Cinhal, Scopus, WOS, SPORTDiscuss, and PEDro. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality and the RoB2 for the evaluation of biases. Results: A total of eight articles were selected. Most of the participants were assessed with the Active Knee Extension or Straight Leg Raise tests. The osteopathic techniques used were the muscle energy technique, suboccipital inhibition, and vertebral mobilisations. As for the control interventions, they mainly included passive stretching and placebo. Conclusions: The results suggest that osteopathic techniques are more effective than placebo or other interventions in increasing flexibility in adult patients with short hamstring syndrome. This effect can be explained by neurophysiological (Golgi apparatus, neuromuscular spindle activity, and Hoffmann reflex) and structural factors (dura mater, posture, and myofascial chains). Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that it would be beneficial to incorporate this type of treatment into flexibility improvement programmes.",

          "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the effect of stretching exercises applied to the hamstring, one of the posterior muscle chains, on musculoskeletal flexibility, chest mobility, and respiratory function. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and static stretching exercises were applied to 30 healthcare personnel caring for children with developmental delays using a crossover randomized study design. Posterior muscle chain mobility was assessed using the popliteal angle test (PAT) for the hamstring muscle, the mobility of the lumbar muscles was assessed using the Schober test (ST), and the mobility of the posterior chain muscles as a whole was assessed using the finger-to-floor distance test. Chest mobility was measured using chest circumference measurements and lung volumes were measured using the pulmonary function test (PFT). The results showed that stretching exercises applied to the hamstrings led to significant improvements in PAT, ST, and chest mobility in the direction of maximal expiration (p < 0.05), without being superior to each other. Ten males (33.3%) and twenty females (66.7%) who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 26.6 ± 5.9 years, the mean height was 169.53 ± 8.67 cm, the mean weight was 65.26 ± 12.03 kg, and the mean body mass index was 22.58 ± 3 kg/m2. Chest inspiratory mechanics also showed a low positive correlation with posterior muscle mobility (r = 0.381; p = 0.038). There was no significant change in PAT.

In the general hamstring strengthening group, participants performed hamstring stretching and strengthening exercises broadly. In contrast, the selective hamstring strengthening group specifically targeted lateral hamstring strengthening and medial hamstring stretching. The treatment program was conducted three times a week for 4 weeks. Pain and disability levels were evaluated before and after treatment using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), quality of life was assessed using the Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life (OAKHQOL) questionnaire, and physical activity levels were determined using the Tegner activity scale.Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in all outcomes except for the quality of life subscale of the KOOS questionnaire (p = .98) in the general hamstring strengthening group. However, the selective hamstring strengthening group exhibited greater improvements in symptoms (p = .02, effect size (d) = 0.92) and pain subscales (p = .01, d = 0.80) according to the KOOS questionnaire. Additionally, the pain subscale (p = .02, d = 0.79) of the OAKHQOL questionnaire exhibited greater improvements in the selective hamstring strengthening group. Tegner activity scale scores significantly improved in both groups.Strengthening the lateral hamstring and stretching the medial hamstring muscles seem to be beneficial for reducing pain in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis and varus deformity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hamstring repair with concurrent sciatic nerve neurolysis for clinical outcomes and patient symptoms.A retrospective chart review of patients who were diagnosed with hamstring injury at a large tertiary care institution was conducted. Patients with chronic tears (> 6 weeks from injury to surgery) who underwent hamstring repair were reviewed for demographics, clinical variables including symptoms of sciatic neuritis, sciatic nerve abnormalities on MRI, and postoperative outcomes. Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables, t test for continuous variables. Pairwise t tests were used to compare average pre- and postoperative strength for patients with and without symptoms of sciatic neuritis.Thirty-two patients with chronic hamstring tears were included in the analysis. Patients were 59.4% female with an average age of 51.4 years (SD 13.1). Preoperatively, 27 patients (84.4%) were noted to have symptoms of sciatic neuritis. These patients did not differ in age (p = .677) or sex (p = .374) from patients without preoperative symptoms. Sciatic nerve abnormalities were noted on MRI report in 7 patients who had sciatic nerve symptoms and 0 patients who did not have sciatic nerve symptoms. Symptomatic improvement was seen in 21/26 (81%) of patients who had preoperative neurological symptoms, and in 6/7 (86%) of patients with MRI findings. All patients had equivalent or improved strength postoperatively.A sciatic nerve neurolysis is a safe and effective procedure to perform on patients with preoperative sciatic nerve symptoms and chronic hamstring tears that leads to improvement in neurological symptoms and strength. In neurologically asymptomatic patients with chronic hamstring injuries and MRI findings indicating possible nerve damage, a discussion should be held about the risks and benefits of performing a sciatic nerve neurolysis.© 2024.

Recently, the foam rolling (FR) methods have also emerged as a passive warm-up.

This study investigated the acute effects of combining nonvibration FR (NVFR) and vibration FR (VFR) prior to PNFS, in comparison with PNFS alone, on hamstring flexibility and thigh skin temperature.Randomized controlled trial.Participants (n = 60) were randomly assigned to PNFS, NVFR + PNFS, VFR + PNFS, and control group (CG). Active knee-extension (AKE), sit and reach (SR) test, and thermal imaging were evaluated before (pre-int), immediately after (post-int), and 30-minutes after (post30-int) intervention.All intervention groups had a significant increase at all time periods (P .05). Combined (NVFR + PNFS/VFR + PNFS) groups had also a significant increase in the post30-int compared with pre-int and post-int values of thigh skin temperature (P < .001). Combined groups, over time, had the best post30-int effect on increasing skin temperature. The study found a significant interaction effect between interventions and time across several measurements (P < .05). Combined groups showed more significant improvements in AKE compared to CG at post-int (P < .05). There is a similar change in AKE, SR test, and skin temperatures between combined groups and PNFS alone at both post-int and post30-int (P < .05).These findings indicate that using FR, with or without vibration, before PNFS does not provide an additional benefit in improving hamstring flexibility and thigh skin temperatures compared with PNFS alone.",

Methods: Plantar pressure (the loading of the first and fifth metatarsal heads (MT1, MT5) and calcaneus) and stabilometry (CoP path length, 90% confidence ellipse area, and maximum CoP speed) were recorded in 28 AS patients (age 56.64 ± 10.3 years; body mass index 29.4 ± 4.9 kg/m2) at the beginning of rehabilitation and after 8 weeks. At first evaluation, there were significant differences (p < 0.05) for the foot loading sites (MT1, MT5, and calcaneus), both for the right and left feet, when comparing eyes open with the other two testing situations. Results: After rehabilitation, significant differences were recorded between eyes-open and head-retroflexed conditions for MT1 (p = 0.03 for right; p = 0.004 for left) and calcaneus (p = 0.014 for right; p = 0.011 for left).

This study examined the effects of hamstring exercise on paraspinal and hamstring stiffness. These findings can inform training and rehabilitation programs to improve muscle health and prevent injuries. Fifteen young, healthy males performed passive and active (submaximal) knee flexion efforts from 0°, 45°, to 90° angle of knee flexion from the prone position. Using shear-wave elastography (SWE) and surface electromyography, we measured the elastic modulus and root mean square (RMS) signal of the erector spinae (ES), multifidus (MF), semitendinosus (ST), and semimembranosus (SM) during different knee flexion angles. Passive SWE modulus at 0° was 12.44 ± 4.45 kPa (ES), 13.35 ± 6.12 kPa (MF), 22.01 ± 4.68 kPa (ST), and 21.57 ± 5.22 kPa (SM) and it was greater (p 0.05). Compared to rest, the relative increase in the SWE modulus during active contraction had a median value (interquartile range) ranging from 68.11 (86.29) to 101.69 (54.33)% for the paraspinal muscles and it was moderately to strongly correlated (r > 0.672) with the corresponding increase of the hamstring muscles [ranging from 225.94 (114.72) to 463.16 (185.16)%]. The RMS signal was greater during active compared to passive conditions, and it was lower at 90° compared to 45° (for SM/ST) and 0° (for all muscles). The association between paraspinal and hamstring passive muscle stiffness indicates a potential transmission of forces through myofascial connections between the lumbar spine and the lower limbs. In this laboratory setting, hamstring exercises affected the stiffness of the paraspinal muscles.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(11): 1860-1866, 2024-Hamstring strain injuries occur when localized tissue strain capacity is exceeded. Localized strain may be affected by intramuscular variation in stiffness, but research in this area is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of intramuscular hamstring stiffness on localized muscle strain during passive hip flexion. Twenty-eight (age 25.0 ± 4.9 years) healthy women ( n = 15) and men ( n = 13) had biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus stiffness measured proximally, medially, and distally during passive hip flexion and extension using shear-wave elastography. Anthropometric and stiffness measurements were entered into an anatomical model of equivalent springs to estimate localized tissue strain and differentiate between the relative contribution to passive strain from each muscular region. In shortened and stretched positions, stiffness was lowest proximally for all muscles (Cohen's d = 0.66-0.79, p < 0.001). In addition, relative strain contribution was greater proximally (37.5-39.4%) compared with middle (31.74-32.2%) or distal (28.6-30.3%) regions ( p < 0.001), with proximal contribution to strain increasing with greater hip flexion. Our results suggest that intramuscular variations in passive hamstring stiffness contribute to inhomogeneous strain throughout the muscle during passive hip flexion. Given the prevalence of proximal stretch-pattern strain injuries, variation in intramuscular stiffness may contribute to risk for such injuries.Copyright © 2024 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",

          "abstract": "The incidence and recurrence rate of hamstring strain injuries remain persistently high, with recurrent injuries leading to increased time lost during play and extended recovery periods compared with initial injury. Ultrasound imaging assesses important factors such as hamstring fascicle length (FL), pennation angle (PA), cross-sectional area (CSA), muscle thickness (MT), echo intensity (EI), and shear wave elastography (SWE), all impacting athletic performance. However, its reliability must be established before employing any measurement tool in research or clinical settings.To determine the reliability and measurement error of ultrasound for assessing hamstring FL, PA, CSA, MT, EI, and SWE among healthy adults and athletes; to synthesize the information regarding the operationalization of ultrasound.A systematic literature search was done from January 1990 to February 5, 2023, to identify reliability and validity studies of hamstring ultrasound assessment published in peer-reviewed journals with identifiable methodology of outcome measures.Intraclass correlation coefficient measurement of 14 included studies reported moderate to excellent intrarater, interrater, and test-retest reliabilities of FL, PA, and MT regardless of the site of muscle testing, probe size, and setting, state of muscle, and use of different techniques in the extrapolation of FL. Good to excellent test-retest reliability rates for all hamstring anatomic CSA along midmuscle and different percentages of thigh length using panoramic imaging. Good intrarater reliability of EI regardless of gender and orientation of the probe but with excellent intrarater reliability in transverse scan using maximum region of interest.

          "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) describes some upper motoneuron disorders due to non-progressive disturbances occurring in the developing brain that cause progressive changes to muscle. While longer sarcomeres increase muscle stiffness in patients with CP compared to typically developing (TD) patients, changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture can increase stiffness. Our goal was to investigate how changes in muscle and ECM architecture impact muscle stiffness, gait and joint function in CP. Gracilis and adductor longus biopsies were collected from children with CP undergoing tendon lengthening surgery for hamstring and hip adduction contractures, respectively. Gracilis biopsies were collected from TD patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery with hamstring autograft. Muscle mechanical testing, two-photon imaging and hydroxyproline assay were performed on biopsies. Corresponding data were compared to radiographic hip displacement in CP adductors (CPA), gait kinematics in CP hamstrings (CPH), and joint range of motion in CPA and CPH. We found at matched sarcomere lengths muscle stiffness and collagen architecture were similar between TD and CP hamstrings. However, CPH stiffness (R2 = 0.1973), collagen content (R2 = 0.5099) and cross-linking (R2 = 0.3233) were correlated to decreased knee range of motion. Additionally, we observed collagen fibres within the muscle ECM increase alignment during muscular stretching. These data demonstrate that while ECM architecture is similar between TD and CP hamstrings, collagen fibres biomechanics are sensitive to muscle strain and may be altered at longer in vivo sarcomere lengths in CP muscle. Future studies could evaluate the impact of ECM architecture on TD and CP muscle stiffness across in vivo operating ranges. KEY POINTS: At matched sarcomere lengths, gracilis muscle mechanics and collagen architecture are similar in TD patients and patients with CP. In both TD and CP muscles, collagen fibres dynamically increase their alignment during muscle stretching. Aspects of muscle mechanics and collagen architecture are predictive of in vivo knee joint motion and radiographic hip displacement in patients with CP. Longer sarcomere lengths in CP muscle in vivo may alter collagen architecture and biomechanics to drive deficits in joint mobility and gait function.© 2024 The Author(s).

This study aimed to investigate the comparative effect of TT and therapeutic ultrasound (US) on hamstring muscle shortness. Additionally, the effects of TT with static stretching (SS) were compared with US combined with SS.Totally, 39 male athletes with hamstring shortness were randomly assigned into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A received 15 minutes of TT plus SS, while Group B received 15 minutes of US with SS, and Group C only performed SS. Hamstring flexibility was measured by active knee extension (AKE), passive knee extension (PKE), and the sit and Reach (SR) tests before the intervention, and following the first, and third treatment sessions.The range of motion of the AKE and PKE, and displacement range in the SR test improved significantly after the first and third sessions in all three groups (P0.0001). The improvement of the three flexibility indices in the TT group was greater than in the other two groups.The present study showed that TT could increase the flexibility of hamstring muscles more than US therapy.

Video footage was obtained, and three raters categorised injury mechanisms and situational patterns. Injuries were also examined according to the month, minute and location.A total of 129 severe hamstring injuries were identified, with 64 occurring in females and 65 in males. Video analysis was possible for 29 (45%) female cases and 61 (94%) male cases. Female injuries had longer lay-off times (97.8 ± 77.1 days) than males (39.6 ± 20.9 days). Females had a higher proportion of indirect contact injuries (34%) than males (13%) and a lower proportion of non-contact injuries (66% vs. 87%). Four situational patterns were identified: running was the most common for both sexes, representing 59% of female injuries and 41% of male injuries. Over-stretching injuries were split across open and CKC scenarios but collectively explained nearly half (48%) of male injuries but only one in five (21%) female injuries.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the acute and chronic effects of static stretching (SS) on intramuscular hamstring stiffness. Thirty healthy active participants had acute changes in passive biceps femoris (BF), semimembranosus (SM), and semitendinosus (ST) stiffness measured at 25% (proximal), 50% (middle), and 75% (distal) muscle length, using shear-wave elastography, immediately after SS. Participants then completed 4 weeks of either a SS intervention (n = 15) or no intervention (CON, n = 15) with stiffness measured before and after the interventions. The acute and chronic effects of SS were compared between anatomical regions and between regions on the basis of their relative stiffness pre-intervention. Acutely, SS decreased stiffness throughout the BF and SM (p ≤ 0.05) but not the ST (p = 0.326). However, a regional effect of stretching was observed for SM and ST with greater reduction in stiffness occurring in stiffer muscular regions (p = 0.001-0.013). Chronically, SS increased BF and ST (p < 0.05), but not SM (p = 0.422) stiffness compared with CON, but no regional effect of stretching was observed in any muscle (p = 0.361-0.833). SS resulted in contrasting acute and chronic effects, acutely decreasing stiffness in stiffer regions while chronically increasing stiffness. These results indicate that the acute effects of SS vary along the muscle's length on the basis of the relative stiffness of the muscle and that acute changes in stiffness from SS are unrelated to chronic adaptations.© 2024 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

A total of 24 female, second-year dance students from Hebei Normal University were selected as participants. They were divided into three distinct groups: Nordic hamstring exercise and single-leg deadlift group (NHE&SLD), forward bending exercises and standing leg lift group (FBE&SLL), and a control group (CG). The study was designed around a 6-week training regimen. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure seated knee flexor-extensor strength, while electronic goniometry was employed to measure hamstring flexibility in the supine position. Paired sample t-tests were conducted within each group, and one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was utilized for comparisons between groups. In the NHE&SLD group, significant disparities were observed in both concentric (T = - 5.687, P = 0.001) and eccentric (T = - 3.626, P = 0.008) hamstring strength pre and post-intervention. The pre-intervention dominant leg concentric strength test values significantly influenced the post-intervention outcomes (F = 5.313, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.840). Similarly, the pre-intervention dominant leg eccentric strength test values impacted the post-intervention results (F = 4.689, P = 0.043, η2 = 0.190). Following the intervention, the NHE&SLD group displayed marked changes in the active straight leg raising angle on both left (T = - 4.171, P = 0.004) and right (T = - 6.328, P = 0.001) sides. The FBE&SLL group also revealed significant changes in the active straight leg raising angle on both left (T = - 4.506, P = 0.003) and right (T = - 4.633, P = 0.002) sides following the intervention. The pre-intervention left leg concentric strength test value significantly influenced the post-intervention outcomes (F = 25.067, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.556). Likewise, the pre-intervention right leg eccentric strength test value significantly influenced the post-intervention results (F = 85.338, P = 0.01, η2 = 0.810). Eccentric training can better enhance the flexibility and strength of hamstring muscles in dance students. Traditional stretching training significantly improves the flexibility of the hamstring muscles. Eccentric training has more training benefits than traditional stretching training. It is recommended for dance students to use eccentric training when increasing hamstring flexibility and strength.© 2024. The Author(s).",

          "title": "Pes Anserine Bursitis",
          "abstract": "The term \"pes anserinus\" translates to “goose's foot” in Latin and refers to the conjoined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus as they insert on the anteromedial proximal tibia (see Image. Pes Anserinus Tendons). The pes anserine tendons, each innervated by a distinct nerve, create a structure about 5 cm distal to the medial knee joint line. As crucial knee flexors, these muscles also aid in tibial internal rotation and provide resistance against rotational and valgus stresses. Located underneath the conjoined tendons is the pes anserinus bursa (see Image. Medial View of the Knee). This synovial tissue-lined structure facilitates smooth movement between the conjoined tendons and tibia. The bursa occasionally cushions between the conjoined tendons and medial collateral ligament (MCL). Bursal inflammation and pain can occur following an injury due to increased synovial fluid production by the bursal cells. Adjacent to the pes anserinus bursa is the musculi sartorii bursa. This fibrous structure is situated between the sartorius tendon and the combined gracilis and semitendinosus tendons. The smaller musculi sartorii bursa may communicate with the pes anserine bursa, and both are commonly referred to collectively as the pes anserine bursa. These bursae do not typically communicate with the knee joint, highlighting their unique anatomical and functional significance in knee movement and pathology. Pes anserine bursitis involves the inflammation of the bursal sac beneath the pes anserinus. The condition predominantly affects women who are overweight and middle-aged. Pes anserinus bursitis is characterized by pain at the pes anserine insertion, typically triggered by activities such as stair climbing or rising from a seated position. Pes anserine bursitis is often associated with other knee disorders, especially osteoarthritis. The condition presents as non-traumatic, spontaneous inferomedial knee pain. Pes anserine bursitis is generally self-limiting, usually responding effectively to conservative treatment methods like exercise and stretching programs. The term \"pes anserine pain syndrome\" encompasses a broader spectrum of medial knee pain, potentially including conditions beyond bursal inflammation. Differentiating between pes anserine bursitis and tendinitis can be challenging, as both the tendons and bursa lie close to each other. However, management for both conditions is the same. Moschcowitz was the first to describe pes anserine bursitis in 1937 as a condition notable for knee pain, primarily in females, elicited by climbing stairs and rising from a seated position. Difficulty with knee flexion was also observed.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the acute effects of static stretching of the hamstrings on maximal sprint speed and its spatiotemporal variables and lower-limb kinematics during the late swing phase, as well as the relationship with Nordic hamstring strength. The study had a within-participant experimental design. Sixteen healthy male college sprinters were asked to sprint 80 m without static stretching and with static stretching of the hamstrings for 4 × 30 s per leg before the sprint; both conditions were counterbalanced. The knee flexion peak torque was measured using the Nordic hamstring. The differences between no static stretching and static stretching as well as their relationship with Nordic hamstring strength were investigated. The results showed that the touchdown distance (p = .036) significantly increased following static stretching. Although not significant, maximal sprint speed decreased (p = .086), and the theoretical hamstring length (difference between knee angle and hip angle) at ipsilateral touchdown was greater (p = .069) following static stretching. In addition, a lower peak torque of the Nordic hamstring resulted in a more significant decrease in maximal sprint speed following static stretching. Therefore, static stretching of the hamstring just before sprinting may increase the theoretical hamstring length during the late swing phase at maximal sprint speed and induce kinematics that increases the hamstring strain injury risk. Moreover, it is suggested that improving the Nordic hamstring strength may help minimize the negative effects of static stretching on the hamstrings.",

          "title": "Effect of isokinetic eccentric training on the human shoulder strength, flexibility, and muscle architecture in physically active men: A preliminary study.",
          "abstract": "Strengthening the rotator cuff muscles is important for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Since muscle fascicle length improves motor performance and is suggested to reduce the risk of injury for the hamstring, it may be an important variable to promote multidirectional changes in the function and macroscopic structure for the shoulder. Recent literature reviews overwhelmingly suggest that eccentric exercises improve fascicle length and functional measures for the lower limb. However, there is a research gap for the shoulder. Since ultrasound imaging is the most commonly used imaging technique to quantify muscle structure, but has yielded heterogeneous results in different studies, there is another issue and a research gap for the imaging method. Based on the research gaps, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of standardized eccentric strength training on the function and structure of the external rotator cuff muscles using an isokinetic dynamometer and MRI. Therefore, a preliminary pre-post intervention study was conducted and 16 physically active men were recruited in October 2021. For the right shoulder, an eccentric isokinetic training was performed twice a week for almost six weeks. The primary outcome measures (external rotators) were active and passive range of motion, eccentric and concentric torque at 30, 60, and 180°/s isokinetic speed, and fascicle length and fascicle volume for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The findings show a training effect for the absolute mean values of eccentric strength (+24%, p = .008). The torque-angle relationship increased, especially in the final phase of range of motion, although a 4% (p = .002) decrease in passive range of motion was found in the stretch test. Positive changes in muscle structure were shown for the supraspinatus muscle fascicle length (+16%, p = .003) and fascicle volume (+19%, p = .002). Based on the study results, we can conclude that eccentric isokinetic training has a significant positive effect on the shoulder. To our knowledge, this is the first eccentric training study using both isokinetic dynamometer and muscle diffusion tensor imaging to access functional and structural changes in the human shoulder rotator cuff muscles. The methods were shown to be applicable for interventional studies. Based on these results, populations such as high-performance handball players with highly trained shoulders should be included in future studies.Copyright: © 2023 Vetter et al.

In group A, the therapist made 30 strokes gentle strokes with the tool from the origin to the insertion while holding the plane at a 45-degree angle over the treatment area. In group B, PNF stretching was done with three repetitions and 10 seconds rest between each, after isometric contraction of the hamstring muscle using approximately 50% of their maximum strength, holding it for 8 seconds, and then releasing it. A 30-minute session was given to each patient three times per week and was given for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity, the active knee extension test (AKET) for hamstring flexibility, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) for the health status of KOA patients.The study found a significant interaction (p < 0.001) between interventions and time across several measurements. After 6 weeks, both interventions resulted in significant improvements (p < 0.001) across all dependent variables, with group A (IASTM) showing more significant improvement in hamstring flexibility, pain reduction, and health status (p < 0.001) compared to group B (PNF).Both the IASTM technique and PNF stretching resulted in increased hamstring flexibility, decreased pain, and enhanced general health. The IASTM technique, however, showed potential benefits over PNF stretching in terms of flexibility, pain relief, and public health enhancement.

Video footage was obtained and three raters independently categorised injury mechanism and situational patterns using a standardised checklist. Injury epidemiology (month), timing of injuries within the match and location of injuries on the pitch were also examined.We identified 121 lower limb severe muscle injuries. Videos of sufficient quality were available for 103 (85%) cases, including 61 (60%) hamstring, 17 (16%) calf, 16 (15%) adductor and 9 (9%) quadricep muscle injuries. Nearly two-thirds of injuries involved the dominant/kicking leg (n=65, 63%). Eighty-five (83%) injuries were non-contact and 18 (17%) indirect contact. Four main situational patterns were identified and accounted for 88% of injuries: (1) running/acceleration (n=35, 34%); (2) closed kinetic chain stretching (n=21, 20%); (3) open kinetic chain stretching (n=19, 18%) and (4) kicking (n=16, 16%), with differences between muscle groups. 71% of injuries occurred in the first half of the match (p<0.01), with a gradual increase through the first half.Most severe muscle injuries during football matches were non-contact and occurred in the first half during running/acceleration, open and closed kinetic chain stretching, or kicking.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the acute effects of static stretching (SS) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching on hamstrings flexibility and shear modulus. Sixteen recreationally active young volunteers participated in a randomized cross-over study. Participants underwent an aerobic warm-up (WU), followed by either SS or PNF stretching. Range of motion (RoM) during passive straight leg raise and active knee extension, as well as shear modulus of the biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles, were measured at baseline, post-WU, and post-stretching. Both stretching techniques significantly increased RoM, with no differences observed between SS and PNF (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.59-0.68). However, only PNF stretching resulted in a significant decrease in BF shear modulus (time×stretching type interaction: p = 0.045; η2 = 0.19), indicating reduced muscle stiffness. No changes in ST shear modulus were observed after either stretching technique. There was no significant correlation between changes in RoM and shear modulus, suggesting that the increase in RoM was predominantly due to changes in stretch tolerance rather than mechanical properties of the muscles. These findings suggest that both SS and PNF stretching can effectively improve hamstring flexibility, but PNF stretching may additionally reduce BF muscle stiffness.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an 8-week posterior and core strengthening program on APT, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio, and vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.Ten healthy males (age = 26±12 years; mass = 87±14 kg; height = 1.8±0.1 m) and nine healthy females (age = 22±4 years; mass = 70±14 kg; heigh t = 1.7±0.1 m) performed resistance training (2×/week; 40-45 mins) involving a combination of hip extensors and abdominal strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals.

Currently, it is unknown if the order an individual performs FR and SS influences flexibility or whether flexibility is retained. This study aimed to determine if FR before, or, following SS influences passive hip flexion range of motion (ROM), and if changes are retained.Between-group experimental design.Thirty-five participants with less than 90° of passive hip flexion ROM volunteered. Over 8 days, 6 days separated by 24 hours, and then 1 week (day 7) and 2 weeks (day 8) following the last treatment, ROM was measured before and following 1 of 5 treatments; FR/SS, SS/FR, SS, FR, or nothing (control). Participants laid supine on a table where a bubble inclinometer was placed on the tibia of the dominant leg with the hip passively flexed to establish pretreatment ROM. Participants then received the treatments. Passive hip flexion ROM was assessed from pretreatment on day 1 to posttreatment on day 6, day 7 (1 wk), and day 8 (2 wk).Passive hip flexion ROM increased for those receiving FR/SS, SS/FR, FR, and SS. ROM with FR and SS/FR was retained at day 7 but not day 8. Hip flexion ROM for FR/SS and SS were not retained at day 7 nor 8. SS/FR resulted in greater ROM than FR on day 6. SS/FR, FR/SS, SS, and FR were greater than the control at day 6. SS/FR was also greater than the control on days 7 and 8.This study revealed that FR the hamstring muscles after SS produces the greatest gains in passive hip flexion and would be appropriate in noninjured patients with less than 90°.",

Therefore, our objectives were to estimate the effect of neurodynamic techniques on HF and to compare the effect of these techniques with static stretching.We systematically searched the Cochrane, MEDLINE(via PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science and Sportdiscus databases for RCTs comparing neurodynamic interventions with control intervention or with static stretching exercises for HF in adults with limited HF. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup analyses according to the type of comparison group(control group or static stretching exercises) and total number of sessions. Furthermore, to reflect the variation in genuine therapy effects in different scenarios, including future patients, we calculated a 95% prediction interval(prI).Thirteen trials were included, involving 624 participants. Pooled results showed a significant improvement in HF for immediate (SMD = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.44 to 1.59) and short-term effects (SMD = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.52). Subgroup analyses by type of comparison group showed that these techniques are more effective than the control group in the immediate and short term and than static stretching in the short term.

Three hamstring constituents were measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography. Skeletal muscle transcriptomes were compared across the genotypes of GWAS-identified variants in 48 healthy Japanese individuals. Association between GWAS-identified variants and history of muscle strain injury were examined in 1,428 Japanese athletes.Two loci on chromosome 11 demonstrated a genome-wide significant association with passive muscle stiffness of the biceps femoris long head (rs12807854 T/C: P = 5.19 × 10-10, rs78405694 T/C: P = 2.09 × 10-8; linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and stretching exercise habits). Skeletal muscle RNA sequencing revealed significantly elevated expression of extracellular matrix-related genes in muscles carrying stiffness-increasing alleles of these variants. Among athletes, rs12807854 T/C was significantly associated with a history of muscle strain injury (P = 0.0254; logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, competitive level, and main sport). Carriers of the C allele, associated with increased muscle stiffness, exhibited a heightened risk of muscle strain injury (odds ratio: 1.62; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.47 per C allele increase). In contrast, rs78405694 did not show a significant association with muscle strain injury in this population.A novel locus associated with passive muscle stiffness and muscle strain injury was identified.

Although eccentric exercises have been shown to increase muscle stiffness, medium- and long-term Nordic hamstring curl training programs have not demonstrated an effect on muscle stiffness. This study examined the acute effects of a single session of Nordic hamstring curls on the stiffness of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles using ultrasound shear wave elastography, an accepted method for measuring passive muscle stiffness.Twenty physically active adults (ages 19-27 years) were randomly assigned to either the Nordic hamstring curl group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). Shear wave elastography was performed on the dominant kicking leg for both groups. The exact location of the probe was marked to ensure the same area was assessed during post-testing. Both groups performed a 5-minute cycle ergometer warm-up followed by three 30-second standing static stretches. The Nordic hamstring curl group then performed three sets of six repetitions of the eccentric phase of the Nordic hamstring curl with 1-minute rest intervals between sets. All subjects then rested for five minutes before shear wave elastography was performed.Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant main effects or interactions for the biceps femoris or semitendinosus (p >0.05). However, analysis of the semimembranosus was inconclusive due to variability of measurement values.These results are in agreement with findings indicating that long- and short-term Nordic hamstring curl training has no impact on hamstring stiffness, although the effects of Nordic hamstring curl on reducing the probability of hamstring injury are still valid.© 2024 Rubén Cámara-Calmaestra et al., published by Sciendo.",

The effects of combining radiofrequency (RF) therapy with static stretching (SS) on hamstring tightness have not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to verify the superiority of combining RF and SS over SS alone by comparing their immediate effects on hamstring flexibility.This randomized controlled study included 33 participants with hamstring tightness. The participants were allocated to the RF (intervention; n = 17) or sham (n = 16) group. The RF group underwent SS simultaneously with RF therapy. The sham group underwent SS with sham RF (powered off). The range of motion (ROM) for knee extension and five muscle properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation, and creep) of the lateral and medial hamstrings were measured before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in the ROM for knee extension (p = 0.295) between the RF and sham groups. The interaction between group and period (p > 0.05) was not significant for any of the muscle properties of the lateral and medial hamstrings besides lateral hamstring elasticity (p = 0.001).RF therapy in conjunction with SS for hamstring tightness produced different changes in muscle properties compared with SS alone. However, these changes did not produce differences in the ROM for knee extension.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Active knee extension (AKE) is widely used to assess hamstring length, and an 'AKE >20°' is often used as the criterion for diagnosing tightness. However, the scientific evidence for this is unclear.This study measured and analysed AKE according to sex in two groups with different exercise participation levels to identify the appropriateness of current criteria.In the supine position, 90° flexion of the hip and knee joints was performed. The maximal knee extension was measured using a goniometer. Cut-off values for diagnosing hamstring tightness were calculated in three different ways as 'mean-1SD', 'mean-2SD', and 'mean-3SD'.There were significant differences in AKE between groups and between sexes. In group A, representing normal healthy adults, cut-off values defined as mean-1SD and mean-2SD were 33.5° and 19.7° in male participants and 28.0° and 15.7° in female participants, respectively. There was a weak correlation between AKE and body mass index, but not between AKE and height and between AKE and weight.This study found that the level of exercise participation significantly affects AKE, and female participants consistently had high flexibility regardless of exercise participation. Therefore, the current cut-off value, widely used in research and clinical settings, may not be a suitable criterion for diagnosing hamstring tightness.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Isokinetic metrics are suggested to be related to vertical jump performance, but little is known about the possible sex differences in this relationship in adolescent track and field athletes. The aim of the study was to examine the possible sex differences in the strength of the relationship between the kinetic parameters of the vertical squat jump with arms akimbo, the countermovement jump with arms akimbo, and the countermovement jump with free arm swing with the isokinetic parameters of the knee extensor and flexor muscles (angular velocities: 60°/s and 300°/s). In total, 35 (males: 21, females: 14) U18 track and field athletes were examined. The results revealed that the Men U18 group had higher vertical jump performance, higher values in the kinetic parameters of the vertical jump tests, higher knee extensor torque, and higher knee flexor torque in the non-dominant leg compared to the Women U18 group. Significant (p < 0.05) sex differences were observed in the relationship between the isokinetic parameters and the vertical jump performance metrics, as the Women U18 athletes relied more on the knee flexor torque than Men U18 athletes, and demonstrated a stronger negative relationship between selected isokinetic metrics and the pre-stretch gain in the vertical jump tests. In conclusion, it is recommended that young female track and field athletes minimize interlimb asymmetry and improve the convention ratio in their non-dominant leg to optimize vertical jump performance.",

Local treatments have obtained controversial results, so it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of other types of therapy such as osteopathic treatment. To evaluate the efficacy of osteopathic techniques in increasing the elasticity of the hamstring musculature in short hamstring syndrome. Methods: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Cinhal, Scopus, WOS, SPORTDiscuss, and PEDro. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality and the RoB2 for the evaluation of biases. Results: A total of eight articles were selected. Most of the participants were assessed with the Active Knee Extension or Straight Leg Raise tests. The osteopathic techniques used were the muscle energy technique, suboccipital inhibition, and vertebral mobilisations. As for the control interventions, they mainly included passive stretching and placebo. Conclusions: The results suggest that osteopathic techniques are more effective than placebo or other interventions in increasing flexibility in adult patients with short hamstring syndrome. This effect can be explained by neurophysiological (Golgi apparatus, neuromuscular spindle activity, and Hoffmann reflex) and structural factors (dura mater, posture, and myofascial chains). Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that it would be beneficial to incorporate this type of treatment into flexibility improvement programmes.",

          "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the effect of stretching exercises applied to the hamstring, one of the posterior muscle chains, on musculoskeletal flexibility, chest mobility, and respiratory function. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and static stretching exercises were applied to 30 healthcare personnel caring for children with developmental delays using a crossover randomized study design. Posterior muscle chain mobility was assessed using the popliteal angle test (PAT) for the hamstring muscle, the mobility of the lumbar muscles was assessed using the Schober test (ST), and the mobility of the posterior chain muscles as a whole was assessed using the finger-to-floor distance test. Chest mobility was measured using chest circumference measurements and lung volumes were measured using the pulmonary function test (PFT). The results showed that stretching exercises applied to the hamstrings led to significant improvements in PAT, ST, and chest mobility in the direction of maximal expiration (p < 0.05), without being superior to each other. Ten males (33.3%) and twenty females (66.7%) who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 26.6 ± 5.9 years, the mean height was 169.53 ± 8.67 cm, the mean weight was 65.26 ± 12.03 kg, and the mean body mass index was 22.58 ± 3 kg/m2.

          "abstract": "Hamstring injuries are common in field-based sports and reinjury rates are high. Recent evidence suggests that hamstring injuries often occur during accelerative running, but investigations of hamstring mechanics have primarily considered constant-speed running. Thus, our objective was to compare hamstring lengths and velocities between accelerative running and constant-speed running.We recorded videos of 10 participants during six accelerative running trials and six constant-speed running trials. We used OpenCap to estimate body segment kinematics and a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model to compute peak length and step-average lengthening velocity of the biceps femoris (long head) muscle-tendon unit. We compared running conditions using linear mixed models with running speed as the independent variable.At running speeds below 75% of top speed, accelerative running resulted in greater peak lengths than constant-speed running. For example, the peak hamstring muscle-tendon length when a person accelerated from running at only 50% of top speed was equivalent to running at a constant 88% of top speed. Lengthening velocities were greater during accelerative running at all running speeds. Differences in hip flexion kinematics drove the greater peak lengths and lengthening velocities observed in accelerative running.Hamstrings are subjected to longer lengths and faster lengthening velocities in accelerative running than in constant-speed running. This provides a potential biomechanical perspective toward understanding the occurrence of hamstring injuries during acceleration. Our results suggest that coaches and sports medicine staff should consider the accelerative nature of running in addition to running speed to quantify exposure to high-risk circumstances with long lengths and fast lengthening velocities of the hamstrings.Copyright © 2024 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",

In the general hamstring strengthening group, participants performed hamstring stretching and strengthening exercises broadly. In contrast, the selective hamstring strengthening group specifically targeted lateral hamstring strengthening and medial hamstring stretching. The treatment program was conducted three times a week for 4 weeks. Pain and disability levels were evaluated before and after treatment using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), quality of life was assessed using the Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life (OAKHQOL) questionnaire, and physical activity levels were determined using the Tegner activity scale.Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in all outcomes except for the quality of life subscale of the KOOS questionnaire (p = .98) in the general hamstring strengthening group. However, the selective hamstring strengthening group exhibited greater improvements in symptoms (p = .02, effect size (d) = 0.92) and pain subscales (p = .01, d = 0.80) according to the KOOS questionnaire. Additionally, the pain subscale (p = .02, d = 0.79) of the OAKHQOL questionnaire exhibited greater improvements in the selective hamstring strengthening group. Tegner activity scale scores significantly improved in both groups.Strengthening the lateral hamstring and stretching the medial hamstring muscles seem to be beneficial for reducing pain in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis and varus deformity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hamstring repair with concurrent sciatic nerve neurolysis for clinical outcomes and patient symptoms.A retrospective chart review of patients who were diagnosed with hamstring injury at a large tertiary care institution was conducted. Patients with chronic tears (> 6 weeks from injury to surgery) who underwent hamstring repair were reviewed for demographics, clinical variables including symptoms of sciatic neuritis, sciatic nerve abnormalities on MRI, and postoperative outcomes. Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables, t test for continuous variables. Pairwise t tests were used to compare average pre- and postoperative strength for patients with and without symptoms of sciatic neuritis.Thirty-two patients with chronic hamstring tears were included in the analysis. Patients were 59.4% female with an average age of 51.4 years (SD 13.1). Preoperatively, 27 patients (84.4%) were noted to have symptoms of sciatic neuritis. These patients did not differ in age (p = .677) or sex (p = .374) from patients without preoperative symptoms. Sciatic nerve abnormalities were noted on MRI report in 7 patients who had sciatic nerve symptoms and 0 patients who did not have sciatic nerve symptoms. Symptomatic improvement was seen in 21/26 (81%) of patients who had preoperative neurological symptoms, and in 6/7 (86%) of patients with MRI findings. All patients had equivalent or improved strength postoperatively.A sciatic nerve neurolysis is a safe and effective procedure to perform on patients with preoperative sciatic nerve symptoms and chronic hamstring tears that leads to improvement in neurological symptoms and strength. In neurologically asymptomatic patients with chronic hamstring injuries and MRI findings indicating possible nerve damage, a discussion should be held about the risks and benefits of performing a sciatic nerve neurolysis.© 2024.

When an appropriate SS duration (<60-seconds per muscle) is incorporated into a dynamic warm-up, performance decrements are often trivial. However, there is a lack of studies that observed the effects of extensive SS (180-seconds) 2-hours prior to a dynamic warm-up. The objective was to investigate ROM and performance effects of prolonged SS, 2-hours prior to a traditional warm-up. This study investigated 9 female and 8 male healthy recreationally active, young adult participants on the effects of prolonged SS (180-seconds per muscle) of the quadriceps and hamstrings, 2-hours before a traditional warm-up compared to an active control condition on hip flexion ROM, knee extension and flexion MVIC forces, CMJ, DJ, and quadriceps and hamstrings electromyography (EMG). There were no significant changes in knee flexion/extension MVIC forces, EMG, CMJ, or DJ height. However, there was significant, small magnitude (p = 0.002) greater post-warm-up left hip flexion ROM (115.4° ± 17.2) than pre-SS (108.9° ± 17.13, Effect size [ES]: 0.28) and control post-warm-up (p = 0.05, ES: 0.31, 109.5° ± 20.55).

Methods: Plantar pressure (the loading of the first and fifth metatarsal heads (MT1, MT5) and calcaneus) and stabilometry (CoP path length, 90% confidence ellipse area, and maximum CoP speed) were recorded in 28 AS patients (age 56.64 ± 10.3 years; body mass index 29.4 ± 4.9 kg/m2) at the beginning of rehabilitation and after 8 weeks. At first evaluation, there were significant differences (p < 0.05) for the foot loading sites (MT1, MT5, and calcaneus), both for the right and left feet, when comparing eyes open with the other two testing situations. Results: After rehabilitation, significant differences were recorded between eyes-open and head-retroflexed conditions for MT1 (p = 0.03 for right; p = 0.004 for left) and calcaneus (p = 0.014 for right; p = 0.011 for left). A significantly higher CoP path length was registered in both initial and final assessments when tested with eyes closed. The maximum CoP speed had increased values at both evaluations when tested with head retroflexed. Conclusions: The CoP path length decreased after the physical exercise program, with a better postural stability after rehabilitation.",

          "abstract": "Soccer teams integrate specific exercises into their typical workout programs for injury prevention. This study examined the effects of hamstring exercise on paraspinal and hamstring stiffness. These findings can inform training and rehabilitation programs to improve muscle health and prevent injuries. Fifteen young, healthy males performed passive and active (submaximal) knee flexion efforts from 0°, 45°, to 90° angle of knee flexion from the prone position. Using shear-wave elastography (SWE) and surface electromyography, we measured the elastic modulus and root mean square (RMS) signal of the erector spinae (ES), multifidus (MF), semitendinosus (ST), and semimembranosus (SM) during different knee flexion angles. Passive SWE modulus at 0° was 12.44 ± 4.45 kPa (ES), 13.35 ± 6.12 kPa (MF), 22.01 ± 4.68 kPa (ST), and 21.57 ± 5.22 kPa (SM) and it was greater (p 0.05). Compared to rest, the relative increase in the SWE modulus during active contraction had a median value (interquartile range) ranging from 68.11 (86.29) to 101.69 (54.33)% for the paraspinal muscles and it was moderately to strongly correlated (r > 0.672) with the corresponding increase of the hamstring muscles [ranging from 225.94 (114.72) to 463.16 (185.16)%]. The RMS signal was greater during active compared to passive conditions, and it was lower at 90° compared to 45° (for SM/ST) and 0° (for all muscles). The association between paraspinal and hamstring passive muscle stiffness indicates a potential transmission of forces through myofascial connections between the lumbar spine and the lower limbs. In this laboratory setting, hamstring exercises affected the stiffness of the paraspinal muscles.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(11): 1860-1866, 2024-Hamstring strain injuries occur when localized tissue strain capacity is exceeded. Localized strain may be affected by intramuscular variation in stiffness, but research in this area is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of intramuscular hamstring stiffness on localized muscle strain during passive hip flexion. Twenty-eight (age 25.0 ± 4.9 years) healthy women ( n = 15) and men ( n = 13) had biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus stiffness measured proximally, medially, and distally during passive hip flexion and extension using shear-wave elastography. Anthropometric and stiffness measurements were entered into an anatomical model of equivalent springs to estimate localized tissue strain and differentiate between the relative contribution to passive strain from each muscular region. In shortened and stretched positions, stiffness was lowest proximally for all muscles (Cohen's d = 0.66-0.79, p < 0.001). In addition, relative strain contribution was greater proximally (37.5-39.4%) compared with middle (31.74-32.2%) or distal (28.6-30.3%) regions ( p < 0.001), with proximal contribution to strain increasing with greater hip flexion. Our results suggest that intramuscular variations in passive hamstring stiffness contribute to inhomogeneous strain throughout the muscle during passive hip flexion.

          "abstract": "The incidence and recurrence rate of hamstring strain injuries remain persistently high, with recurrent injuries leading to increased time lost during play and extended recovery periods compared with initial injury. Ultrasound imaging assesses important factors such as hamstring fascicle length (FL), pennation angle (PA), cross-sectional area (CSA), muscle thickness (MT), echo intensity (EI), and shear wave elastography (SWE), all impacting athletic performance. However, its reliability must be established before employing any measurement tool in research or clinical settings.To determine the reliability and measurement error of ultrasound for assessing hamstring FL, PA, CSA, MT, EI, and SWE among healthy adults and athletes; to synthesize the information regarding the operationalization of ultrasound.A systematic literature search was done from January 1990 to February 5, 2023, to identify reliability and validity studies of hamstring ultrasound assessment published in peer-reviewed journals with identifiable methodology of outcome measures.Intraclass correlation coefficient measurement of 14 included studies reported moderate to excellent intrarater, interrater, and test-retest reliabilities of FL, PA, and MT regardless of the site of muscle testing, probe size, and setting, state of muscle, and use of different techniques in the extrapolation of FL.

          "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) describes some upper motoneuron disorders due to non-progressive disturbances occurring in the developing brain that cause progressive changes to muscle. While longer sarcomeres increase muscle stiffness in patients with CP compared to typically developing (TD) patients, changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture can increase stiffness. Our goal was to investigate how changes in muscle and ECM architecture impact muscle stiffness, gait and joint function in CP. Gracilis and adductor longus biopsies were collected from children with CP undergoing tendon lengthening surgery for hamstring and hip adduction contractures, respectively. Gracilis biopsies were collected from TD patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery with hamstring autograft. Muscle mechanical testing, two-photon imaging and hydroxyproline assay were performed on biopsies. Corresponding data were compared to radiographic hip displacement in CP adductors (CPA), gait kinematics in CP hamstrings (CPH), and joint range of motion in CPA and CPH. We found at matched sarcomere lengths muscle stiffness and collagen architecture were similar between TD and CP hamstrings. However, CPH stiffness (R2 = 0.1973), collagen content (R2 = 0.5099) and cross-linking (R2 = 0.3233) were correlated to decreased knee range of motion. Additionally, we observed collagen fibres within the muscle ECM increase alignment during muscular stretching. These data demonstrate that while ECM architecture is similar between TD and CP hamstrings, collagen fibres biomechanics are sensitive to muscle strain and may be altered at longer in vivo sarcomere lengths in CP muscle. Future studies could evaluate the impact of ECM architecture on TD and CP muscle stiffness across in vivo operating ranges. KEY POINTS: At matched sarcomere lengths, gracilis muscle mechanics and collagen architecture are similar in TD patients and patients with CP. In both TD and CP muscles, collagen fibres dynamically increase their alignment during muscle stretching. Aspects of muscle mechanics and collagen architecture are predictive of in vivo knee joint motion and radiographic hip displacement in patients with CP. Longer sarcomere lengths in CP muscle in vivo may alter collagen architecture and biomechanics to drive deficits in joint mobility and gait function.© 2024 The Author(s).

Passive muscle stiffness is a potential risk factor for a sprint-type hamstring strain injury, but limited information is available about the effect of short-term training cessation on passive muscle stiffness. The present study aimed to identify whether and how passive muscle stiffness of the biceps femoris long head (BFlh) would vary due to 2 weeks of training cessation in sprinters.Passive BFlh shear-wave speed (a proxy for stiffness) was measured using ultrasound shear-wave elastography in 28 male sprinters, before and after 2 weeks of intervention. During the 2 weeks, the participants in the training-cessation group (n = 14) were allowed to maintain their normal daily activities but not to perform any physical training, including stretching and resistance exercises. The participants in the training continuation group (n = 14) performed the training (including maximum speed sprint, plyometric, and weight training) prescribed by their coaches 5 days per week.In the training-cessation group, passive BFlh shear-wave speed increased after the 2 weeks of training cessation (4.75 ± 0.77 to 5.00 ± 0.88 m/s, P < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference before and after the 2 weeks of training continuation (4.90 ± 0.85 to 4.93 ± 0.85 m/s, P = 0.521).The present findings indicate that muscles stiffen by training cessation in sprinting athletes.© 2024.

Video footage was obtained, and three raters categorised injury mechanisms and situational patterns. Injuries were also examined according to the month, minute and location.A total of 129 severe hamstring injuries were identified, with 64 occurring in females and 65 in males. Video analysis was possible for 29 (45%) female cases and 61 (94%) male cases. Female injuries had longer lay-off times (97.8 ± 77.1 days) than males (39.6 ± 20.9 days). Females had a higher proportion of indirect contact injuries (34%) than males (13%) and a lower proportion of non-contact injuries (66% vs. 87%). Four situational patterns were identified: running was the most common for both sexes, representing 59% of female injuries and 41% of male injuries.

The EG performed a home-based thoracic mobilization exercise program comprising 2 sets with 10 repetitions, once a day, 3 days a week, for 4 weeks. The CG performed active-assisted stretching of the hamstring comprising 3 sets with 10 repetitions for 15 seconds. The active knee extension (AKE) test was used to measure hamstring flexibility, and self-reported hamstring pain intensity was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS). All evaluations were conducted at the beginning and end of the intervention.Both groups showed significant improvement in AKE (p<0.05). Pain intensity during the stretching exercises was significantly decreased only in the EG. The improvements in AKE and VAS score were greater in the EG than in the CG (p < 0.05). Between-group effect sizes were large for AKE (d = 1.075) and VAS score (d = 1.077).The current study showed that thoracic mobilization exercises may increase hamstring flexibility and reduce pain intensity during hamstring stretch exercises.© TÜBİTAK.",

However, a stretching method that can both decrease muscle-tendon unit (MTU) stiffness and increase muscle strength has not been developed. The purpose of this study was to examine the combined effects of 30 seconds of static stretching at different intensities (normal-intensity static stretching [NS] and high-intensity static [HS]) and dynamic stretching at different speeds (low-speed dynamic [LD] and high-speed dynamic stretching [HD]) on the MTU stiffness and muscle strength of the hamstrings. Thirteen healthy subjects (9 men and 4 women, 20.9 ± 0.8 years, 169.3 ± 7.2 cm, 61.1 ± 8.2 kg) performed 4 types of interventions (HS-HD, HS-LD, NS-HD, and NS-LD). Range of motion (ROM), passive torque, MTU stiffness, and muscle strength were measured before and immediately after interventions by using an isokinetic dynamometer machine. In all interventions, the ROM and passive torque significantly increased (p < 0.01). Muscle-tendon unit stiffness significantly decreased in HS-HD and HS-LD (both p < 0.01), but there was no significant change in NS-HD (p = 0.30) or NS-LD (p = 0.42). Muscle strength significantly increased after HS-HD (p = 0.02) and NS-LD (p = 0.03), but there was no significant change in HS-LD (p = 0.23) or NS-LD (p = 0.26).

          "abstract": "The objective of this research is to examine the impact of eccentric training on hamstring flexibility and strength in young dancers during the concluding stages of their foundational dance training program. A total of 24 female, second-year dance students from Hebei Normal University were selected as participants. They were divided into three distinct groups: Nordic hamstring exercise and single-leg deadlift group (NHE&SLD), forward bending exercises and standing leg lift group (FBE&SLL), and a control group (CG). The study was designed around a 6-week training regimen. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure seated knee flexor-extensor strength, while electronic goniometry was employed to measure hamstring flexibility in the supine position. Paired sample t-tests were conducted within each group, and one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was utilized for comparisons between groups. In the NHE&SLD group, significant disparities were observed in both concentric (T = - 5.687, P = 0.001) and eccentric (T = - 3.626, P = 0.008) hamstring strength pre and post-intervention. The pre-intervention dominant leg concentric strength test values significantly influenced the post-intervention outcomes (F = 5.313, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.840). Similarly, the pre-intervention dominant leg eccentric strength test values impacted the post-intervention results (F = 4.689, P = 0.043, η2 = 0.190). Following the intervention, the NHE&SLD group displayed marked changes in the active straight leg raising angle on both left (T = - 4.171, P = 0.004) and right (T = - 6.328, P = 0.001) sides. The FBE&SLL group also revealed significant changes in the active straight leg raising angle on both left (T = - 4.506, P = 0.003) and right (T = - 4.633, P = 0.002) sides following the intervention. The pre-intervention left leg concentric strength test value significantly influenced the post-intervention outcomes (F = 25.067, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.556). Likewise, the pre-intervention right leg eccentric strength test value significantly influenced the post-intervention results (F = 85.338, P = 0.01, η2 = 0.810). Eccentric training can better enhance the flexibility and strength of hamstring muscles in dance students. Traditional stretching training significantly improves the flexibility of the hamstring muscles. Eccentric training has more training benefits than traditional stretching training. It is recommended for dance students to use eccentric training when increasing hamstring flexibility and strength.© 2024. The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

The purpose of this case series is to describe the rehabilitation modalities and treatments utilized in working dogs with fibrotic myopathy and the time frame they were able to continue working.Medical records of patients with hindlimb lameness that were presented to the Schwarzman Animal Medical Center in New York City from 2012 to 2023 were retrospectively searched. Signalment, history, clinical evaluation, gait analysis, goniometry of stifles, and follow-up evaluation were compared among patients. Ten male working dogs met inclusion criteria. Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ECSWT) was administered under sedation or general anesthesia. Rehabilitation therapy (RT), including massage, hamstring stretch, photobiomodulation, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, warm compress, therapeutic ultrasound, underwater treadmill, and therapeutic exercises, were performed once every one to 3 weeks with varying protocols according to patient assessments. Follow-up phone calls and emails were conducted to determine long-term outcome.On average, dogs were able to work full-time for 32.1 months (range 6-82; SD 23.6) from the time of diagnosis. No activity limitation was reported by the owners/handlers.This report is the first to describe non-invasive medical treatments that may extend the working ability of dogs diagnosed with fibrotic myopathy. Further prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of ECSWT and RT for treating fibrotic myopathy.The results of this retrospective study suggest that the combination of ECSWT and RT may allow working dogs with fibrotic myopathy to continue their working capacity for an extended period of time.Copyright © 2024 Tsai and Alvarez.",

The study had a within-participant experimental design. Sixteen healthy male college sprinters were asked to sprint 80 m without static stretching and with static stretching of the hamstrings for 4 × 30 s per leg before the sprint; both conditions were counterbalanced. The knee flexion peak torque was measured using the Nordic hamstring. The differences between no static stretching and static stretching as well as their relationship with Nordic hamstring strength were investigated. The results showed that the touchdown distance (p = .036) significantly increased following static stretching. Although not significant, maximal sprint speed decreased (p = .086), and the theoretical hamstring length (difference between knee angle and hip angle) at ipsilateral touchdown was greater (p = .069) following static stretching. In addition, a lower peak torque of the Nordic hamstring resulted in a more significant decrease in maximal sprint speed following static stretching. Therefore, static stretching of the hamstring just before sprinting may increase the theoretical hamstring length during the late swing phase at maximal sprint speed and induce kinematics that increases the hamstring strain injury risk. Moreover, it is suggested that improving the Nordic hamstring strength may help minimize the negative effects of static stretching on the hamstrings.",

          "title": "Effect of isokinetic eccentric training on the human shoulder strength, flexibility, and muscle architecture in physically active men: A preliminary study.",
          "abstract": "Strengthening the rotator cuff muscles is important for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Since muscle fascicle length improves motor performance and is suggested to reduce the risk of injury for the hamstring, it may be an important variable to promote multidirectional changes in the function and macroscopic structure for the shoulder. Recent literature reviews overwhelmingly suggest that eccentric exercises improve fascicle length and functional measures for the lower limb. However, there is a research gap for the shoulder. Since ultrasound imaging is the most commonly used imaging technique to quantify muscle structure, but has yielded heterogeneous results in different studies, there is another issue and a research gap for the imaging method. Based on the research gaps, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of standardized eccentric strength training on the function and structure of the external rotator cuff muscles using an isokinetic dynamometer and MRI. Therefore, a preliminary pre-post intervention study was conducted and 16 physically active men were recruited in October 2021. For the right shoulder, an eccentric isokinetic training was performed twice a week for almost six weeks. The primary outcome measures (external rotators) were active and passive range of motion, eccentric and concentric torque at 30, 60, and 180°/s isokinetic speed, and fascicle length and fascicle volume for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The findings show a training effect for the absolute mean values of eccentric strength (+24%, p = .008). The torque-angle relationship increased, especially in the final phase of range of motion, although a 4% (p = .002) decrease in passive range of motion was found in the stretch test. Positive changes in muscle structure were shown for the supraspinatus muscle fascicle length (+16%, p = .003) and fascicle volume (+19%, p = .002). Based on the study results, we can conclude that eccentric isokinetic training has a significant positive effect on the shoulder. To our knowledge, this is the first eccentric training study using both isokinetic dynamometer and muscle diffusion tensor imaging to access functional and structural changes in the human shoulder rotator cuff muscles. The methods were shown to be applicable for interventional studies. Based on these results, populations such as high-performance handball players with highly trained shoulders should be included in future studies.Copyright: © 2023 Vetter et al.

In group A, the therapist made 30 strokes gentle strokes with the tool from the origin to the insertion while holding the plane at a 45-degree angle over the treatment area. In group B, PNF stretching was done with three repetitions and 10 seconds rest between each, after isometric contraction of the hamstring muscle using approximately 50% of their maximum strength, holding it for 8 seconds, and then releasing it. A 30-minute session was given to each patient three times per week and was given for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity, the active knee extension test (AKET) for hamstring flexibility, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) for the health status of KOA patients.The study found a significant interaction (p < 0.001) between interventions and time across several measurements.

Sixteen recreationally active young volunteers participated in a randomized cross-over study. Participants underwent an aerobic warm-up (WU), followed by either SS or PNF stretching. Range of motion (RoM) during passive straight leg raise and active knee extension, as well as shear modulus of the biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles, were measured at baseline, post-WU, and post-stretching. Both stretching techniques significantly increased RoM, with no differences observed between SS and PNF (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.59-0.68). However, only PNF stretching resulted in a significant decrease in BF shear modulus (time×stretching type interaction: p = 0.045; η2 = 0.19), indicating reduced muscle stiffness. No changes in ST shear modulus were observed after either stretching technique. There was no significant correlation between changes in RoM and shear modulus, suggesting that the increase in RoM was predominantly due to changes in stretch tolerance rather than mechanical properties of the muscles. These findings suggest that both SS and PNF stretching can effectively improve hamstring flexibility, but PNF stretching may additionally reduce BF muscle stiffness. The study highlights the importance of considering individual muscle-specific responses to stretching techniques and provides insights into the mechanisms underpinning acute increases in RoM.© 2023.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an 8-week posterior and core strengthening program on APT, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio, and vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.Ten healthy males (age = 26±12 years; mass = 87±14 kg; height = 1.8±0.1 m) and nine healthy females (age = 22±4 years; mass = 70±14 kg; heigh t = 1.7±0.1 m) performed resistance training (2×/week; 40-45 mins) involving a combination of hip extensors and abdominal strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals.

          "abstract": "Hamstring range of motion (ROM) and the influence it has on injury risk is among great discussion in the literature. Hamstring injury may result from hamstring tightness, poor flexibility, or decreased ROM, and many argue that this can be prevented through various intervention strategies. In active populations, risk of further injury, pain, and complications throughout the kinetic chain can occur if minimal hamstring ROM is left untreated. One therapeutic intervention that has been applied to varying parts of the body to help improve function while relieving pain is dry needling (DN). This intervention includes the application of needles to structures to induce responses that might benefit healing and overall stimulation of a neurological response. In this review, the intent is to identify evidence and the effects of DN on hamstring ROM.What are the effects of DN on hamstring ROM?Among total 11 articles, 1 single-blinded randomized controlled trial and 2 double-blinded randomized controlled trials were included in this critically appraised topic. All 3 articles had inconclusive evidence to isolate the application of the DN intervention. There was insufficient evidence to identify if DN independently improved hamstring ROM; however, in combination with interventions such as exercise and stretch plans, there were improvements on ROM.DN does not significantly increase or decrease the ROM of the hamstrings. When combined with exercise and stretch plans, DN could increase ROM.The grade of B is recommended by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy for inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence.",

          "title": "A Conceptual Exploration of Hamstring Muscle-Tendon Functioning during the Late-Swing Phase of Sprinting: The Importance of Evidence-Based Hamstring Training Frameworks.",
          "abstract": "An eccentrically lengthening, energy-absorbing, brake-driven model of hamstring function during the late-swing phase of sprinting has been widely touted within the existing literature. In contrast, an isometrically contracting, spring-driven model of hamstring function has recently been proposed. This theory has gained substantial traction within the applied sporting world, influencing understandings of hamstring function while sprinting, as well as the development and adoption of certain types of hamstring-specific exercises. Across the animal kingdom, both spring- and motor-driven muscle-tendon unit (MTU) functioning are frequently observed, with both models of locomotive functioning commonly utilising some degree of active muscle lengthening to draw upon force enhancement mechanisms. However, a method to accurately assess hamstring muscle-tendon functioning when sprinting does not exist. Accordingly, the aims of this review article are three-fold: (1) to comprehensively explore current terminology, theories and models surrounding muscle-tendon functioning during locomotion, (2) to relate these models to potential hamstring function when sprinting by examining a variety of hamstring-specific research and (3) to highlight the importance of developing and utilising evidence-based frameworks to guide hamstring training in athletes required to sprint. Due to the intensity of movement, large musculotendinous stretches and high mechanical loads experienced in the hamstrings when sprinting, it is anticipated that the hamstring MTUs adopt a model of functioning that has some reliance upon active muscle lengthening and muscle actuators during this particular task. However, each individual hamstring MTU is expected to adopt various combinations of spring-, brake- and motor-driven functioning when sprinting, in accordance with their architectural arrangement and activation patterns. Muscle function is intricate and dependent upon complex interactions between musculoskeletal kinematics and kinetics, muscle activation patterns and the neuromechanical regulation of tensions and stiffness, and loads applied by the environment, among other important variables. Accordingly, hamstring function when sprinting is anticipated to be unique to this particular activity. It is therefore proposed that the adoption of hamstring-specific exercises should not be founded on unvalidated claims of replicating hamstring function when sprinting, as has been suggested in the literature. Adaptive benefits may potentially be derived from a range of hamstring-specific exercises that vary in the stimuli they provide. Therefore, a more rigorous approach is to select hamstring-specific exercises based on thoroughly constructed evidence-based frameworks surrounding the specific stimulus provided by the exercise, the accompanying adaptations elicited by the exercise, and the effects of these adaptations on hamstring functioning and injury risk mitigation when sprinting.© 2023.

Injuries predominantly affected the right side (55%). Elbow flexion strength was assessed using the British Medical Research Council scale. Positive Tinel sign was present in 73% of patients, all reporting pain ranging from mild to severe. At 1 year postsurgery, 64% achieved M4 elbow flexion, 27% achieved M3, and 9% achieved M1 after 4 months. Patients >65 who received surgery within 6 months of injury showed better outcomes except for 1 case. No ulnar nerve deficits were observed. Following surgery, 36% experienced no pain, whereas 64% reported mild pain. Additionally, 64% underwent further nerve transfers to restore shoulder function (spinal accessory nerve to suprascapular nerve), and 18% underwent the Somsakprocedure for deltoid function.Positive outcomes were achieved with the Oberlin technique in patients >60 with upper BPIs from low-energy trauma. However, delayed surgery, significant atrophy, and low testosterone levels may affect results.

The difference in the effect depends on the stretching methods, including the position, duration, and intensity and position at which the shear elastic modulus is measured. Therefore, we should establish stretching methods for each muscle and investigate chronic effects on the shear elastic modulus.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "title": "Effects of chronic ankle instability after grade I ankle sprain on the post-traumatic osteoarthritis.",
          "abstract": "Untreated acute ankle sprains often result in chronic ankle instability (CAI) and can ultimately lead to the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). At present, a typical animal model of ankle instability in mice is established by transecting the ligaments around the ankle joint. This study aimed to establish a grade I acute ankle sprain animal model by rapid stretching of peri-ankle joint ligaments. Furthermore, we tried to explore the pathophysiological mechanism of ankle osteoarthritis.In all, 18 male C57BL/6 J mice (7 weeks) were randomly divided into three groups: calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) laxity group, deltoid ligament (DL) laxity group, and SHAM group. One week after the surgical procedure, all mice were trained to run in the mouse rotation fatigue machine daily. The mice were tested on the balance beam before surgery and three days, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after surgery. Footprint analyses were performed on each mouse before surgery and 12 weeks after surgery. Micro-CT scanning was then performed to evaluate the degeneration of ankle joints and histological staining was performed to analyze and evaluate PTOA caused by ankle joint instability.After surgery, the mice in the CFL and DL laxity groups took longer to cross the balance beam and slipped more often than those in the SHAM group (p < 0.05). The step length and width in the CFL and DL laxity groups were significantly shorter and smaller than those in the SHAM group 12 weeks after surgery (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in the CFL and DL laxity groups compared with the SHAM group (p < 0.05). Histological staining results suggested obvious signs of PTOA in the CFL and DL laxity groups.Based on CFL and DL laxity in a mouse ankle instability model, this study suggests that grade I ankle sprain can contribute to chronic ankle instability, impair motor coordination and balance, and eventually lead to PTOA of ankle with significant degeneration of its adjacent joints.© 2024.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the severity of adhesion between muscles in the shoulder joint using dynamic ultrasonography and to confirm whether adhesions cause range of motion (ROM) restrictions.Twenty-four shoulders from 15 frozen shoulder patients and 24 shoulders from 18 rotator cuff disorder patients were enrolled. We obtained ultrasound video sequences of the subscapularis (SSC) and deltoid muscles during shoulder external rotation. The mean stretching velocities of the deltoid and SSC were subsequently analyzed using a personal computer. If adhesions occurred between both muscles, the deltoid was stretched more vigorously, and we calculated mean stretching velocity of the deltoid / SSC as adhesion severity. The coracohumeral ligament thickness was measured using the same images. Shoulder ROM was measured by using a universal goniometer.The intraclass correlation coefficients (1.1) and (2.1) of the adhesion severity measurements were 0.85 and 0.91, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the adhesion severity is a significant predictor for external rotation ROM in the rotator cuff disorder group (R2 = 0.44, F = 10.1, P < .01, t = -2.9), while coracohumeral ligament thickness predicts ROM in the frozen shoulder group (R2 = 0.28, F = 5.5, P = .01, t = -3.0).The proposed method is reliable. Muscle adhesion causes ROM restriction of the shoulder joint. The primary cause of shoulder ROM restriction differed between the diagnostic groups.© 2024 The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "Surgical reconstruction of elbow extension can help restore function in patients with tetraplegia and triceps paralysis because of spinal cord injury. Both posterior deltoid-to-triceps tendon transfer and transfer of the branch of the axillary nerve to the triceps motor branch of the radial nerve have been described for triceps reanimation. This systematic review aimed at reviewing current evidence in the two schools of surgery in terms of their outcome and complication profile.A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE (1974-2023) and EMBASE (1946-2023) databases. The keyword terms \"elbow extension,\" \"triceps,\" \"deltoid,\" \"nerve transfer,\" \"spinal cord injury,\" \"tetraplegia,\" \"quadriplegia,\" and \"tetraplegic\" were used in the initial search, which was supplemented with manual searches of the bibliographies of retrieved articles.Twenty studies met our inclusion criteria, with 14 studies (229 limbs) on posterior deltoid-to-triceps tendon transfer, 5 studies (23 limbs) on axillary to radial nerve transfer, and 1 study (1 limb) on combined transfer. For the tendon transfer group, the majority of studies reported a median triceps power of grade 3, with a wide range of failure percentage to reach antigravity (0% to 87.5%). Common complications included gradual stretching of the musculotendinous unit, rupture of the tendon transferred, elbow contracture, and infection. For the nerve transfer group, the majority of studies also reported a median triceps power reaching grade 3. There were no reported complications or loss of power in donor action of shoulder abduction or external rotation.Transfer of the axillary nerve branch to the triceps motor branch of the radial nerve in tetraplegia shows promising results, with comparable triceps muscle power compared to traditional tendon transfer and a low incidence of complication.Systematic Review III.© 2023 The Authors.",

The O-arm (a mobile X-ray system; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) is uniquely capable of enabling visualization of the spine in axial planes. The application of this technology is wide yet underutilized in terms of its capacity to image spinal vascular anatomy. We completed a retrospective chart review of the following case studies. A 24-year-old neurologically intact female presented with a Jefferson fracture without vertebral artery dissection after a motor vehicle accident. After the failure of conservative management due to pseudoarthrosis, the patient opted for fusion. Prior to the procedure, bilateral 5 French femoral sheaths were placed. After exposure, intraarterial (IA) contrast was injected prior to the O-arm spin to visualize both vertebral arteries, which were stretched and adjacent to a mobile boney segment. In the second case, a 71-year-old male presented with right shoulder pain and a flaccid left deltoid secondary to a large enhancing epidural lesion spanning C4-C7. Further work-up confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Prior to resection with cervical spinal stabilization, a right radial artery 4 French Glidesheath was placed. Prior to the O-arm spin, the right vertebral artery was selected, and intravenous contrast was injected to permit visualization of the vertebral artery, which was encased within the tumor and at significant risk for iatrogenic injury. Both patients tolerated the endovascular and spinal procedures well without vertebral artery injury. This is the first series to report the effective use of the O-arm for improved visualization of vascular anatomy during surgery for cervical spinal trauma and oncology.Copyright © 2024, Mugge et al.",

To ensure that an experiment determines what we intend, the design must be carefully evaluated. Before analyzing data, it is imperative to limit the number of outliers, biases, and skewness. In the present study, a simple center-out experiment was performed by 16 healthy volunteers. The experiment included three load conditions, two preparatory delays, two perturbations, and four targets placed along a diagonal path on a 2D plane. While the participants performed the tasks, the activity of seven arm muscles were monitored using surface electromyography (EMG). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the study design, identify muscle synergies, and assess the effects of individual quirks. With PCA, we can identify the trials that trigger stretch reflexes and pinpoint muscle synergies. The posterior deltoid, triceps long head, and brachioradialis were engaged when targets were in the direction of muscle shortening and the perturbation was applied in the opposite direction. Similarly, the pectoralis and anterior deltoid were engaged when the targets were in the direction of muscle shortening and the perturbation was applied in the opposite direction. The stretch reflexes were not triggered when the perturbation brought the hand in the direction of, or into the target, except if the muscle was pre-loaded. The use of PCA was also proven valuable when evaluating participant performance. While individual quirks are to be expected, failure to perform trials as expected can adversely affect the study results.Copyright: © 2023 Frida Torell.

          "abstract": "Decisions for action are accompanied by a continual processing of sensory information, sometimes resulting in a revision of the initial choice, called a change of mind (CoM). Although the motor system is tuned during the formation of a reach decision, it is unclear whether its preparatory state differs between CoM and non-CoM decisions. To test this, participants (n = 14) viewed a random-dot motion (RDM) stimulus of various coherence levels for a random viewing duration. At the onset of a mechanical perturbation that rapidly stretched the pectoralis muscle, they indicated the perceived motion direction by making a reaching movement to one of two targets. Using electromyography (EMG), we quantified the reflex gains of the pectoralis and posterior deltoid muscles. Results show that reflex gains scaled with both the coherence level and the viewing duration of the stimulus. We fit a drift diffusion model (DDM) to the behavioral choices. The decision variable (DV), derived from the DDM, correlated well with the measured reflex gain at the single-trial level. However, when matched on DV magnitude, reflex gains were significantly lower in CoM than non-CoM trials. We conclude that the internal state of the motor system, as measured by the spinal reflexes, reflects the continual deliberation on sensory evidence for action selection, including the postdecisional evidence that can lead to a change of mind.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using behavioral findings, EMG, and computational modeling, we show that not only the perceptual decision outcome but also the accumulating evidence for that outcome is continuously sent to the relevant muscles. Moreover, we show that an upcoming change of mind can be detected in the motor periphery, suggesting that a correlate of the internal decision making process is being sent along.",

          "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-associated plexopathy mainly occurs in patients over 60 years old. Postherpetic neuralgia is a well-known complication of herpes zoster (HZ); however, segmental zoster paresis secondary to HZ was reported in 1-20% of cases in the literature. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings may be positive in up to 70% of the patients. We describe a 43-year-old male patient with a history of grade two left frontal oligodendroglioma, which was treated with two partial resections, radiation treatment and procarbazine/lomustine, who presented with left upper extremity pain and developed a blistering rash in a dermatomal pattern in the left proximal upper extremity two weeks after the initial symptoms. He was diagnosed with shingles and treated with steroids and acyclovir with minimal improvement. Six weeks after the initial symptoms, a physical exam revealed left deltoid, supraspinatus and infraspinatus weakness with normal muscle stretch reflexes and decreased sensation on the C5 dermatome. Electromyography (EMG) revealed absent left lateral antebrachial cutaneous sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) amplitude and a small left radial SNAP amplitude compared to the right side. Evidence of ongoing denervation with reinnervation was seen in the left upper trunk-supplied muscles. MRI of the brachial plexus was negative for any abnormalities. The patient was diagnosed with VZV-associated plexopathy, which improved with pregabalin and physical therapy. Our patient was significantly younger than expected in the HZ group. MRI usually shows T2 hyperintensities and thickening of the nerve roots in patients with VZV-associated plexopathy. However, the presentation, onset of symptoms, characteristics of the rash, and clinical course were diagnostic of HZ, and the weakness pattern, supported by the EMG findings, was diagnostic of VZV-associated plexopathy.Copyright © 2023, Gül et al.",

The pathogenesis of HSP is complex, and muscle hypertonia, especially the hypertonia of internal rotation muscles of the shoulder, may be one of the important causes of shoulder pain. However, the relationship between muscle stiffness and HSP has not been well studied. The purpose of this study is to explore the correlations between the stiffness of internal rotation muscles and clinical symptoms in patients with HSP.A total of 20 HSP patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited for this study. The stiffness of internal rotation muscles was quantified using shear wave elastography, and Young's modulus (YM) of the pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD), teres major ™, and latissimus dorsi (LD) were measured. Muscle hypertonia and pain intensity were evaluated using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), respectively. The mobility of the shoulder was evaluated using the Neer score. The correlations between muscle stiffness and the clinical scales were analyzed.YM of internal rotation muscles on the paretic side was higher than that of the control group in the resting and passive stretching positions (P < 0.05). YM of internal rotation muscles on the paretic side during passive stretching was significantly higher than that at rest (P < 0.05). YM of PM, TM, and LD during passive stretching were correlated with MAS (P < 0.05). In addition, the YM of TM during passive stretching was positively correlated with VAS and negatively correlated with the Neer score (P < 0.05).Increased stiffness of PM, TM, and LD was observed in patients with HSP.

          "abstract": "Stretch reflexes are crucial for performing accurate movements and providing rapid corrections for unpredictable perturbations. Stretch reflexes are modulated by supraspinal structures via corticofugal pathways. Neural activity in these structures is difficult to observe directly, but the characterization of reflex excitability during volitional movement can be used to study how these structures modulate reflexes and how neurological injuries impact this control, such as in spasticity after stroke. We have developed a novel protocol to quantify stretch reflex excitability during ballistic reaching. This novel method was implemented using a custom haptic device (NACT-3D) capable of applying high-velocity (270 °/s) joint perturbations in the plane of the arm while participants performed 3D reaching tasks in a large workspace. We assessed the protocol on four participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke and two control participants. Participants reached ballistically from a near to a far target, with elbow extension perturbations applied in random catch trials. Perturbations were applied before movement, during the early phase of movement, or near peak movement velocity. Preliminary results show that stretch reflexes were elicited in the stroke group in the biceps muscle during reaching, as measured by electromyographic (EMG) activity both before (pre-motion phase) and during (early motion phase) movement. Reflexive EMG was also seen in the anterior deltoid and pectoralis major in the pre-motion phase. In the control group, no reflexive EMG was seen, as expected. This newly developed methodology allows the study of stretch reflex modulation in new ways by combining multijoint movements with haptic environments and high-velocity perturbations.",

The arch of the foot is a tough, elastic connection of ligaments, tendons, and fascia between the forefoot and the hindfoot. The talocalcaneal interosseous ligament, tibionavicular portion of the deltoid ligament, spring ligament, and medial talocalcaneal ligament assist in stabilizing the arch of the foot. The arch serves as an adaptive and flexible base for the entire body. It functions to dissipate the forces of weight-bearing and acts to store mechanical energy within the stretched elastic ligaments during the gait cycle. Dysfunction of the arch complex, specifically relating to flexible flat foot, can frequently be asymptomatic but can alter the biomechanics of the lower limbs and lumbar spine, causing an increased risk of pain and injury.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

Forty-nine patients who had undergone postmastectomy breast reconstruction, 17 who had undergone chemoradiation, and 18 healthy, age-matched controls were enrolled.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two different treatment programs: progressive resistance exercises plus manual therapy (PRE plus MT) and motor control exercises (MCE), on isometric strength of upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MTr), lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA), supraspinatus (Supr.), anterior deltoid (A.D), and latissimus dorsi (LD). 80 male university-level overhead athletes clinically diagnosed with SIS were randomly allocated into either of the two groups: PRE plus MT and MCE group. Athletes in the PRE plus MT group underwent graduated exercises with resistance elastic band, stretching exercises, and mobilization of the thoracic and shoulder joints. MCE group was submitted to motor control exercises in varied planar positions. Athletes in both groups underwent management 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Isometric strength of UT, MTr, LT, Supr, A.D, SA, and LD was measured at three-time points: baseline, 4th week, and 8th week. Relative to baseline, both interventions were found to be effective in increasing and optimizing the isometric strength of muscles (p 0.05). However, athletes in PRE plus MT group presented a more pronounced increase in isometric strength than those in the MCE group.

          "abstract": "Before the role of shear wave elastography (SWE) and B mode ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of different forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) can be investigated, normative data is required. This study aimed to describe and then compare normative SWE and B mode ultrasound metrics of muscles in healthy controls and patients with IIM.Twenty nine healthy adult controls and 10 IIM patients (5 with inclusion body myositis and 5 with necrotising autoimmune myopathy) underwent a full clinical examination, laboratory investigations, SWE and US measurements of selected proximal and distal limb muscles. Shear wave speed (SWS) and multiple US domains [echogenicity, fascial thickness, muscle bulk and power Doppler (PD)] were measured in both groups.In healthy controls (n = 29; mean age 46.60 ± 16.10; 44.8 % female), age was inversely correlated with SWS at the deltoid (stretch) (Rs. -0.40, p = 0.030) and PD score at the deltoid (rest) (Rs. -0.40, P = 0.032). Those ≥ 50 years old had a lower SWS at the deltoid (stretch) compared to the < 50 year group (2.92 m/s vs. 2.40 m/s, P = 0.032). Age correlated with increased echogenicity in the flexor digitorum profundus (Rs. 0.38, P = 0.045). Females had a smaller muscle bulk in the deltoid (P = 0.022). Body mass index (BMI) was inversely associated with SWS in the deltoid (stretch) (Rs - 0.45, P = 0.026), and positively correlated with echogenicity in the deltoid (Rs. 0.69, P = 0.026). In patients ≥50 years of age, patients with IIM (mean age 61.00 ± 8.18; females 20.0 %) had a higher proportion of abnormal echogenicity scores at the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) (40.00 % vs. 14.30 %, P = 0.022) and tibialis anterior (TA) (80.00 % vs. 28.60 %, P = 0.004). Fascial thickness was lower in the FDP (0.63mm vs. 0.50mm, p = 0.012) and TA (0.58mm vs. 0.45mm, P = 0.001).Our findings suggest there is scope for US techniques to be useful for diagnostic screening of affected muscles in patients with IIM, especially in those with suspected inclusion body myositis or necrotising autoimmune myopathy. We provide normative data for future studies into SWE and US techniques in skeletal muscle. The differences between IIM patients and controls warrant further study in a broader IIM patient cohort.",

The aim of this study was to compare muscle elasticity between the healthy and the involved sides in children with neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) using the elastography tool and to assess whether the difference was correlated with the Mallet grading system. We repeatedly measured the shear modulus coefficient of several muscles around the shoulder in stretched or passively relaxed positions on 14 patients. We evaluated the abductor muscles (supraspinatus and deltoid), the infraspinatus, the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. We found a mean shear modulus significantly higher in most studied muscles in the pathologic side (P < 0.001), especially in the stretched position (P < 0.001). Moreover, the shear modulus increases with the degradation of the Mallet score for the abduction and external rotation tasks.

Principal component analysis (PCA) for 35 parameters extracted components identified variables that contributed most to variability in the dataset. γ-AchR was higher in SS than control, indicating denervation. Satellite cells in SS had a low baseline level of activity (Pax7+ cells labelled in S-phase) versus control; only satellite cells in SS showed increased proliferative activity after nitric oxide-donor treatment. Interestingly, satellite cell localization of Semaphorin 3A, a neuro-chemorepellent, was greater in SS (consistent with fiber denervation) than control muscle at baseline. PCAs extracted components including fiber atrophy, satellite cell activity, fibrosis, atrogin-1, smoking status, vascular density, γAchR, and the time between symptoms and surgery. Use of deltoid as a control for SS was supported by PCA findings since \"muscle\" was not extracted as a variable in the first two principal components. SS muscle in RCI is therefore atrophic, denervated, and fibrotic, and has satellite cells that respond to activating stimuli.Since SS satellite cells can be activated in culture, a NO-donor drug combined with stretching could promote muscle growth and improve functional outcome after RCI. PCAs suggest indices including satellite cell responsiveness, atrogin-1, atrophy, and innervation may predict surgical outcome.",

          "abstract": "The deltoid muscle plays a critical role in the biomechanics of shoulders undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). However, both pre- and postoperative assessment of the deltoid muscle quality still remains challenging. The purposes of this study were to establish a novel methodology of shear wave elastography (SWE) to quantify the mechanical properties of the deltoid muscle, and to investigate the reliability of this technique using cadaveric shoulders for the purpose of RSA. Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were obtained. The deltoid muscles were divided into 5 segments (A1, A2, M, P1 and P2) according to the muscle fiber orientation and SWE values were measured for each segment. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). To measure the response of muscle tension during RSA, the humeral shaft was osteotomized and subsequently elongated by an external fixator (intact to 15 mm elongation). SWE of the deltoid muscle was measured under each stretch condition. Intra- and inter-observer reliability of SWE measurements for all regions showed 0.761-0.963 and 0.718-0.947 for ICC(2,1). Especially, SWE measurements for segments A2 and M presented satisfactory repeatability. Elongated deltoid muscles by the external fixator showed a progressive increase in passive stiffness for all muscular segments. Especially, SWE outcomes of segments A2 and M reliably showed an exponential growth upon stretching (R2 = 0.558 and 0.593). Segmental measurements using SWE could be reliably and feasibly used to quantitatively assess the mechanical properties of the deltoid muscle, especially in the anterior and middle portions. This novel technique based on the anatomical features may provide helpful information of the deltoid muscle properties during treatment of RSA.",

After a therapist's guided intensive movement of crossed arms in front of the body, upward, as high as possible, a sudden ache in the left shoulder that radiated to the lateral upper arm occurred along with loss of elevation and abduction of the shoulder.

          "abstract": "It has been reported that the 90° arm abduction force counteracting external adduction loads appeared to be smaller under teeth clenching condition than under non-clenching condition. To elucidate the physiological mechanism underlying the possible inhibitory effect of teeth clenching on the arm abduction, we have attempted to quantify the difference in the force induced against the fast and slow ramp load between the arm abductions under teeth non-clenching and clenching conditions. When the load of adduction moment was linearly increased, the abductor force increased to a maximal isometric contraction force (MICF) and further increased to a maximal eccentric contraction force (MECF) with forced adduction. The MICF measured under teeth clenching was significantly lower than that under non-clenching, despite no significant difference in the MECF between the two conditions. The reduction in MICF caused by teeth clenching was enhanced by increasing the velocity of the load. These results suggest that clenching inhibits abduction force only during isometric contraction phase. The invariability of MECF would indicate the lack of involvement of fatigue in such inhibitory effects of clenching. To discover the source of the inhibition, we have examined the effects of teeth clenching on the stretch reflex in the deltoid muscle. The stretch reflex of deltoid muscles was inhibited during clenching, contrary to what was expected from the Jendrassik maneuver. Taken together, our results suggest that the teeth clenching reduced the MICF by depressing the recruitment of deltoid motoneurones presumably via the presynaptic inhibition of spindle afferent inputs onto those motoneurones.",

We proposed a simple anatomical study in order to assess the macroscopic effects on the axillary nerve when lowering the humerus as performed during RSA implantation. We also measured the effect on the axillary nerve of a lateralization of the humerus. Between 2011 and 2012, cadaveric dissections of 16 shoulder specimens from nine fresh human cadavers were performed in order to assess the effects on the axillary nerve after the lowering and lateralization of the humerus. We assessed the extent of stretching of the axillary nerve in four positions in the sagittal plane [lowering of the humerus: great tuberosity in contact with the acromion (position 1), in contact with the upper (position 2), middle (position 3) and lower rim of the glenoid (position 4)] and three positions in the frontal plane [lateralization of the humerus: humerus in contact with the glenoid (position 1), humerus lateralized 1 cm (position 2) and 2 cm (position 3)]. When the humerus was lowered, clear macroscopical changes appeared below the middle of the glenoid (the highest level of tension). As regards the lateralization of the humerus, macroscopic study and measurements confirm the absence of stretching of the nerve in those positions. Lowering of the humerus below the equator of the glenoid changes the course and tension of the axillary nerve and may lead to stretching and irreversible damage, compromising the function of the deltoid.

Forty-three women and 17 men (mean age = 54 years, range 43-73 years) with posterior shoulder tightness participated and were randomized into massage and control groups (n = 30 per group). A physical therapist provided the massage on the posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, and teres minor of the involved shoulder for 18 minutes [about 6 minutes for each muscle] two times a week for 4 weeks. For the control group, one therapist applied light hand touch on the muscles 10 minutes two times a week for 4 weeks. Glenohumeral internal rotation ROM, functional status, and muscle tightness were the main outcomes. Additionally, the potential factors on the effectiveness of massage were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. For this analysis, patients with functional score improvement at least 20% after massage were considered responsive, and the others were considered nonresponsive.Fifty-two patients completed the study (29 for the massage and 23 for the control). The overall mean internal rotation ROM increased significantly in the massage group compared to the control (54.9° v.s. 34.9°; P ≤ 0.001). There were 21 patients in the responsive group and 8 in the nonresponsive group. Among the factors, duration of symptoms, functional score, and posterior deltoid tightness were significant predictors of effectiveness of massage.Massage was an effective treatment for patients with posterior shoulder tightness, but was less effective in patients with longer duration of symptoms, higher functional limitation, and less posterior deltoid tightness.This clinical trial is registered at Trial Registration \"Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01022827\".",

          "abstract": "Reconstruction of triceps function in persons with tetraplegia is an established surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to investigate and evaluate patient perspective of gains in activity and satisfaction after surgical reconstruction of triceps function and subsequent rehabilitation.We studied the effects of surgery and rehabilitation in 14 persons (19 arms) treated with deltoid-to-triceps transfer. We used Canadian Occupational Performance Measurement standards to capture the performance and satisfaction of patient-identified activity goals. Follow-up was performed at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. To make group analyses, we classified activity goals according to the International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health categories of activities and participation, as well as relative to the position of the arm in space.Patients reported improvement in performance after surgery, and satisfaction was rated even higher. Improvement was seen in all types of activities that patients had prioritized. No single goal was rated lower at 12 months' follow-up than before surgery. The most common activity gains were related to \"driving a wheelchair\" and the ability to \"reach out,\" each of which represented 20% of expressed goals. Although \"driving a wheelchair\" and \"moving the body\" (transfers) were common goals, the smallest improvements for both performance and satisfaction after 12 months were seen in these areas. We observed the highest performance improvement in the category of \"writing\" and the ability to \"stretch out the arm when lying down.\"Improvement in activity continues over the first year after triceps reconstruction. Complex activities continue to improve over a longer period than simpler activities. We saw the highest improvement in activities performed without the aid of gravity and activities highly dependent on coordination. Such actions are difficult to compensate for by technique or skills, and therefore elbow extension is essential for performance.Therapeutic IV.Copyright © 2012 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

Preoperative status of the axillary nerve was evaluated by using the Louisiana State University Health Science Center (LSUHSC) grading system published by the senior authors. Intraoperative nerve action potential recordings were performed to check nerve conduction and assess the possibility of resection. Neurolysis, suture, and nerve grafts were used for the surgical repair of the injured nerves. In 9 patients with partial loss of function and 3 with complete loss, neurolysis based on nerve action potential recordings was the primary treatment. Two patients with complete loss of function were treated with resection and suturing and 12 with resection and nerve grafting. The minimum follow-up period was 16 months (mean 20 months).The injuries were associated with the following sports: skiing (12 cases), football (5), rugby (2), baseball (2), ice hockey (2), soccer (1), weightlifting (1), and wrestling (1). Functional recovery was excellent. Neurolysis was performed in 9 cases, resulting in an average functional recovery of LSUHSC Grade 4.2.

          "abstract": "During a set of resistance exercise performed until exhaustion, the relationship between intensity and the number of repetitions can be affected by lifting speed, with faster speeds producing higher numbers. The hypothesized mechanisms include enhanced utilization of the stretch-shortening cycle. This study investigated muscle activations under varying speeds and intensities during bench press using surface electromyography (EMG) to suggest further mechanisms for the above finding. Thirteen weight-trained men (21.7 ± 3.6-year-old) performed bench press until fatigue under five intensities (40-80% 1RM), and four speeds (slow 5.6-s/repetition, medium 2.8-s/repetition, fast 1.9-s/repetition, and ballistic maximum speed). Surface EMG was recorded from the pectoralis, deltoid, and triceps for root-mean-square amplitude and median frequency. EMG amplitudes were greater for faster and heavier conditions before fatigue. Faster conditions, however, produced a significant fall in amplitude during the final concentric phase compared to slower movements. After fatigue, EMG amplitude increased, with the speed effect being maintained. The intensity effect on amplitude either disappeared or remained similar, depending on the muscles. Median frequencies before fatigue were similar among speeds and intensities. The fall in frequency after fatigue was similar across speeds, but greater for lighter intensities. It was concluded that reduced muscle activation during the final concentric phase in faster conditions allowed a better muscle pump, explaining the increased repetition numbers. Fatigue levels are likely to have been similar across speeds, but greater for lower intensities. An incomplete rise in EMG amplitude after fatigue for lower intensities could imply an increased contribution of central fatigue or neuromuscular transmission failure.",

After reaming of the humeral canal, a stem is cemented in place. The Affinis Fracture prosthesis consists of three parts: the stem (3 sizes), a metaphyseal part (2 sizes), and a ceramic head (3 sizes). The retroversion of the metaphyseal part is freely adjustable (360°) after cementing the stem. The length can be adjusted over 1 cm. After reconstruction of the height and retroversion, the tuberosities are reattached anatomically. Finally, a compression osteosynthesis of the tuberosities is realized, using a metal cable, compressing the tuberosities directly upon the metaphyseal part.As the stability of this construct is very high, early postoperative mobilization is allowed. In order to avoid adhesion, rehabilitation exercises are started the day after surgery. During the first few days, passive mobilization, within pain limits, is performed. As soon as possible, active assisted mobilization is started. No stretching is performed, especially in rotation, before the sixth postoperative week.

The present study aimed to test an effect of massage on electrical (EMG) and mechanical (MMG) activities of a muscle lying distant, but indirectly connected to, the massaged muscle. Thirty-three healthy men participated in the study. To record the activity of the middle deltoid muscle the brachioradialis was massaged, and for the tensor fasciae latae-the peroneal muscles were massaged. An EMG/MMG hybrid probe was used to detect EMG and MMG signals from the middle deltoid and tensor fasciae latae muscles. The EMG amplitude increased during massage in the tensor fasciae lata only, while the MMG amplitude increased significantly in both muscles. It was concluded that there was an electrical as well as a mechanical response of muscle connected indirectly by structural elements with the muscle being massaged indicating an application for the tensegrity principle in massage therapy. It also has a practical importance, because it provides a means for a physiotherapist to influence adverse muscle tension by massaging another distant muscle.",

Peak EMG activity was measured in 13 healthy physical education students for concentric 2-second phases during bench press exercises at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of maximal repetition, and for 6 movements with the device tested (4 different grips, 3 arms positions, both in concentric and isometric conditions). The main results show that the muscle solicitation that could be reached was significantly different depending on the grip used (p < 0.05) and was equivalent to that observed in bench press exercises performed against loads ranging from 20 to 80% of the maximal repetition. Changing arm position (from the standard position of use to outstretched arms or a butterfly-like position) resulted in significantly increasing levels of activation for the pectoralis major and the anterior deltoid. The instability phenomena observed when performing isometric actions with this device did not result in higher levels of activation, which does not allow us to classify it among instability devices (such as wobble boards or balls).

Injuries predominantly affected the right side (55%). Elbow flexion strength was assessed using the British Medical Research Council scale. Positive Tinel sign was present in 73% of patients, all reporting pain ranging from mild to severe. At 1 year postsurgery, 64% achieved M4 elbow flexion, 27% achieved M3, and 9% achieved M1 after 4 months. Patients >65 who received surgery within 6 months of injury showed better outcomes except for 1 case. No ulnar nerve deficits were observed. Following surgery, 36% experienced no pain, whereas 64% reported mild pain. Additionally, 64% underwent further nerve transfers to restore shoulder function (spinal accessory nerve to suprascapular nerve), and 18% underwent the Somsakprocedure for deltoid function.Positive outcomes were achieved with the Oberlin technique in patients >60 with upper BPIs from low-energy trauma. However, delayed surgery, significant atrophy, and low testosterone levels may affect results. Evaluation of each patient's medical history is crucial before performing this procedure.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the severity of adhesion between muscles in the shoulder joint using dynamic ultrasonography and to confirm whether adhesions cause range of motion (ROM) restrictions.Twenty-four shoulders from 15 frozen shoulder patients and 24 shoulders from 18 rotator cuff disorder patients were enrolled. We obtained ultrasound video sequences of the subscapularis (SSC) and deltoid muscles during shoulder external rotation. The mean stretching velocities of the deltoid and SSC were subsequently analyzed using a personal computer. If adhesions occurred between both muscles, the deltoid was stretched more vigorously, and we calculated mean stretching velocity of the deltoid / SSC as adhesion severity. The coracohumeral ligament thickness was measured using the same images. Shoulder ROM was measured by using a universal goniometer.The intraclass correlation coefficients (1.1) and (2.1) of the adhesion severity measurements were 0.85 and 0.91, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the adhesion severity is a significant predictor for external rotation ROM in the rotator cuff disorder group (R2 = 0.44, F = 10.1, P < .01, t = -2.9), while coracohumeral ligament thickness predicts ROM in the frozen shoulder group (R2 = 0.28, F = 5.5, P = .01, t = -3.0).The proposed method is reliable. Muscle adhesion causes ROM restriction of the shoulder joint. The primary cause of shoulder ROM restriction differed between the diagnostic groups.© 2024 The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "Surgical reconstruction of elbow extension can help restore function in patients with tetraplegia and triceps paralysis because of spinal cord injury. Both posterior deltoid-to-triceps tendon transfer and transfer of the branch of the axillary nerve to the triceps motor branch of the radial nerve have been described for triceps reanimation. This systematic review aimed at reviewing current evidence in the two schools of surgery in terms of their outcome and complication profile.A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE (1974-2023) and EMBASE (1946-2023) databases. The keyword terms \"elbow extension,\" \"triceps,\" \"deltoid,\" \"nerve transfer,\" \"spinal cord injury,\" \"tetraplegia,\" \"quadriplegia,\" and \"tetraplegic\" were used in the initial search, which was supplemented with manual searches of the bibliographies of retrieved articles.Twenty studies met our inclusion criteria, with 14 studies (229 limbs) on posterior deltoid-to-triceps tendon transfer, 5 studies (23 limbs) on axillary to radial nerve transfer, and 1 study (1 limb) on combined transfer. For the tendon transfer group, the majority of studies reported a median triceps power of grade 3, with a wide range of failure percentage to reach antigravity (0% to 87.5%). Common complications included gradual stretching of the musculotendinous unit, rupture of the tendon transferred, elbow contracture, and infection. For the nerve transfer group, the majority of studies also reported a median triceps power reaching grade 3. There were no reported complications or loss of power in donor action of shoulder abduction or external rotation.Transfer of the axillary nerve branch to the triceps motor branch of the radial nerve in tetraplegia shows promising results, with comparable triceps muscle power compared to traditional tendon transfer and a low incidence of complication.Systematic Review III.© 2023 The Authors.",

          "abstract": "Adhesive capsulitis following vaccination is a rare complication secondary to improper intramuscular (IM) deltoid vaccine administration. It is considered a subset of the broad category known as shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA). SIRVA typically results from improper shoulder anatomic localization prior to injection, leading to erroneous placement of the needle into the glenohumeral joint capsule or subacromial space. This can trigger a wide array of pathologies, including adhesive capsulitis. We present the first known case of adhesive capsulitis following improper tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine administration. The patient, a previously healthy middle-aged female, began experiencing significant anterior left shoulder pain the day following a Td booster vaccination. She remarked receiving the injection \"higher up\" in the shoulder than normal. Over the next two weeks, she began noting significant shoulder stiffness, which was followed by a progressive loss of shoulder range of motion. Her symptoms persisted for four months without definitive diagnosis or treatment. After four months of symptoms, the patient visited an outpatient sports medicine clinic where the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis was made. Although the patient was referred for physical therapy, focusing on gentle range of motion (ROM) and stretches, followed by a planned isometric strengthening program once ROM improved, she was eventually lost to follow-up, and her recovery is unclear. Given the rarity of the diagnosis, it is unclear if adhesive capsulitis, secondary to improper IM vaccination, follows the same temporal course as \"classic\" adhesive capsulitis or results in a different timeframe of recovery. Further studies are needed on this subject.Copyright © 2024, Weinberg et al.",

The O-arm (a mobile X-ray system; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) is uniquely capable of enabling visualization of the spine in axial planes. The application of this technology is wide yet underutilized in terms of its capacity to image spinal vascular anatomy. We completed a retrospective chart review of the following case studies. A 24-year-old neurologically intact female presented with a Jefferson fracture without vertebral artery dissection after a motor vehicle accident. After the failure of conservative management due to pseudoarthrosis, the patient opted for fusion. Prior to the procedure, bilateral 5 French femoral sheaths were placed. After exposure, intraarterial (IA) contrast was injected prior to the O-arm spin to visualize both vertebral arteries, which were stretched and adjacent to a mobile boney segment. In the second case, a 71-year-old male presented with right shoulder pain and a flaccid left deltoid secondary to a large enhancing epidural lesion spanning C4-C7. Further work-up confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Prior to resection with cervical spinal stabilization, a right radial artery 4 French Glidesheath was placed. Prior to the O-arm spin, the right vertebral artery was selected, and intravenous contrast was injected to permit visualization of the vertebral artery, which was encased within the tumor and at significant risk for iatrogenic injury. Both patients tolerated the endovascular and spinal procedures well without vertebral artery injury. This is the first series to report the effective use of the O-arm for improved visualization of vascular anatomy during surgery for cervical spinal trauma and oncology.Copyright © 2024, Mugge et al.",

The pathogenesis of HSP is complex, and muscle hypertonia, especially the hypertonia of internal rotation muscles of the shoulder, may be one of the important causes of shoulder pain. However, the relationship between muscle stiffness and HSP has not been well studied. The purpose of this study is to explore the correlations between the stiffness of internal rotation muscles and clinical symptoms in patients with HSP.A total of 20 HSP patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited for this study. The stiffness of internal rotation muscles was quantified using shear wave elastography, and Young's modulus (YM) of the pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD), teres major ™, and latissimus dorsi (LD) were measured. Muscle hypertonia and pain intensity were evaluated using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), respectively. The mobility of the shoulder was evaluated using the Neer score. The correlations between muscle stiffness and the clinical scales were analyzed.YM of internal rotation muscles on the paretic side was higher than that of the control group in the resting and passive stretching positions (P < 0.05). YM of internal rotation muscles on the paretic side during passive stretching was significantly higher than that at rest (P < 0.05).

Athletes in the PRE plus MT group underwent graduated exercises with resistance elastic band, stretching exercises, and mobilization of the thoracic and shoulder joints. MCE group was submitted to motor control exercises in varied planar positions. Athletes in both groups underwent management 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Isometric strength of UT, MTr, LT, Supr, A.D, SA, and LD was measured at three-time points: baseline, 4th week, and 8th week. Relative to baseline, both interventions were found to be effective in increasing and optimizing the isometric strength of muscles (p 0.05). However, athletes in PRE plus MT group presented a more pronounced increase in isometric strength than those in the MCE group. Between groups analysis found the largest isometric strength improvement in PRE plus MT group for A.D, followed by Supr. and UT muscles (p < 0.05; effect size: 0.39 to 0.40).

We evaluated the abductor muscles (supraspinatus and deltoid), the infraspinatus, the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. We found a mean shear modulus significantly higher in most studied muscles in the pathologic side (P < 0.001), especially in the stretched position (P < 0.001).

However, both pre- and postoperative assessment of the deltoid muscle quality still remains challenging. The purposes of this study were to establish a novel methodology of shear wave elastography (SWE) to quantify the mechanical properties of the deltoid muscle, and to investigate the reliability of this technique using cadaveric shoulders for the purpose of RSA. Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were obtained. The deltoid muscles were divided into 5 segments (A1, A2, M, P1 and P2) according to the muscle fiber orientation and SWE values were measured for each segment. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). To measure the response of muscle tension during RSA, the humeral shaft was osteotomized and subsequently elongated by an external fixator (intact to 15 mm elongation). SWE of the deltoid muscle was measured under each stretch condition. Intra- and inter-observer reliability of SWE measurements for all regions showed 0.761-0.963 and 0.718-0.947 for ICC(2,1). Especially, SWE measurements for segments A2 and M presented satisfactory repeatability. Elongated deltoid muscles by the external fixator showed a progressive increase in passive stiffness for all muscular segments. Especially, SWE outcomes of segments A2 and M reliably showed an exponential growth upon stretching (R2 = 0.558 and 0.593). Segmental measurements using SWE could be reliably and feasibly used to quantitatively assess the mechanical properties of the deltoid muscle, especially in the anterior and middle portions.

          "abstract": "Clinical and subclinical neurological injury after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) may jeopardize functional outcomes due to the risk of irreversible damage to the axillary nerve. We proposed a simple anatomical study in order to assess the macroscopic effects on the axillary nerve when lowering the humerus as performed during RSA implantation. We also measured the effect on the axillary nerve of a lateralization of the humerus. Between 2011 and 2012, cadaveric dissections of 16 shoulder specimens from nine fresh human cadavers were performed in order to assess the effects on the axillary nerve after the lowering and lateralization of the humerus. We assessed the extent of stretching of the axillary nerve in four positions in the sagittal plane [lowering of the humerus: great tuberosity in contact with the acromion (position 1), in contact with the upper (position 2), middle (position 3) and lower rim of the glenoid (position 4)] and three positions in the frontal plane [lateralization of the humerus: humerus in contact with the glenoid (position 1), humerus lateralized 1 cm (position 2) and 2 cm (position 3)]. When the humerus was lowered, clear macroscopical changes appeared below the middle of the glenoid (the highest level of tension). As regards the lateralization of the humerus, macroscopic study and measurements confirm the absence of stretching of the nerve in those positions. Lowering of the humerus below the equator of the glenoid changes the course and tension of the axillary nerve and may lead to stretching and irreversible damage, compromising the function of the deltoid. Improvements in the design of the implants and modification of the positioning of the glenosphere to avoid notching and to increase mobility must take into account the anatomical changes induced by the prosthesis and its impact on the brachial plexus.

          "abstract": "Clinical approaches like mobilization, stretching, and/or massage may decrease shoulder tightness and improve symptoms in subjects with stiff shoulders. We investigated the effect and predictors of effectiveness of massage in the treatment of patients with posterior shoulder tightness.A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a hospital-based outpatient practice (orthopedic and rehabilitation). Forty-three women and 17 men (mean age = 54 years, range 43-73 years) with posterior shoulder tightness participated and were randomized into massage and control groups (n = 30 per group). A physical therapist provided the massage on the posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, and teres minor of the involved shoulder for 18 minutes [about 6 minutes for each muscle] two times a week for 4 weeks. For the control group, one therapist applied light hand touch on the muscles 10 minutes two times a week for 4 weeks. Glenohumeral internal rotation ROM, functional status, and muscle tightness were the main outcomes. Additionally, the potential factors on the effectiveness of massage were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. For this analysis, patients with functional score improvement at least 20% after massage were considered responsive, and the others were considered nonresponsive.Fifty-two patients completed the study (29 for the massage and 23 for the control). The overall mean internal rotation ROM increased significantly in the massage group compared to the control (54.9° v.s. 34.9°; P ≤ 0.001). There were 21 patients in the responsive group and 8 in the nonresponsive group. Among the factors, duration of symptoms, functional score, and posterior deltoid tightness were significant predictors of effectiveness of massage.Massage was an effective treatment for patients with posterior shoulder tightness, but was less effective in patients with longer duration of symptoms, higher functional limitation, and less posterior deltoid tightness.This clinical trial is registered at Trial Registration \"Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01022827\".",

After reaming of the humeral canal, a stem is cemented in place. The Affinis Fracture prosthesis consists of three parts: the stem (3 sizes), a metaphyseal part (2 sizes), and a ceramic head (3 sizes). The retroversion of the metaphyseal part is freely adjustable (360°) after cementing the stem. The length can be adjusted over 1 cm. After reconstruction of the height and retroversion, the tuberosities are reattached anatomically. Finally, a compression osteosynthesis of the tuberosities is realized, using a metal cable, compressing the tuberosities directly upon the metaphyseal part.As the stability of this construct is very high, early postoperative mobilization is allowed. In order to avoid adhesion, rehabilitation exercises are started the day after surgery. During the first few days, passive mobilization, within pain limits, is performed. As soon as possible, active assisted mobilization is started. No stretching is performed, especially in rotation, before the sixth postoperative week.

The posterior part of the deltoid muscle inserted muscular fibres directly onto the posterior portion of the brachial fascia, its lateral part onto the lateral portion and the lateral intermuscular septum. In MR images, the brachial fascia appeared as a low-signal-intensity sinuous line of connective tissue, sharply delineated in T(1)-weighted sequences.The expansions of the pectoral girdle muscles onto the brachial fascia were present in all the subjects and showed a quite constant course with a specific spatial organization.

          "abstract": "The maximal torque effect of the middle portion of action of the deltoid muscle while raising an out-stretched upper limb was measured from left and right sides of normal untrained young adults and of the same age elite athletes. Seventeen strongly right-handed untrained males and females and 10 elite tennis players were tested. All participants were required to raise (abduct) one arm (right and then left, or vice versa) as fast as possible with maximal amplitude while standing on an electronic platform scale which measured to 0.001 kg. An assumed force at the centre of mass of the entire upper limb was considered. The force consisted of two components, namely static weight force of the upper limb and a dynamic force component created by upward acceleration of the limb. Using regression equations and scaling methods the static weight of the upper limb was derived and combined with the dynamic component to produce the total force, applied to the centre of mass of the limb. The total force multiplied by the distance from the centre of mass to point of rotation of the limb equated to the torque produced by deltoid muscle. Using video system analyses the angle of abduction was measured for each individual exercise. The additional anthropometrical tests identified proportionality and body mass indices for each participant. There was no significant difference in dynamic force and torque between left and right limb from the three groups. Sportsmen demonstrated greater lateral abduction when performing the exercise from the dominant side of the body. Sportsmen also demonstrated greater range of abduction, bigger dynamic force and torque on both sides in comparison to untrained adults. Remarkably, the absolute and relative length of arms of athletes were shorter in comparison to untrained males, but the radius of gyration from the stretched upper limb (from its centre of gravity to the shoulder joint) were greater. This phenomenon may be due to distal shifting of the gravity center of the entire upper limb in elite athletes, perhaps, because greater investment of the distal portion of the limb with skeletal muscle tissue.",

          "abstract": "A novel cadaveric model for anterior-inferior shoulder dislocation using forcible apprehension positioning is presented. This model simulates an in vivo mechanism and yields capsulolabral lesions. The scapulae of 14 cadaveric entire upper limbs (82 +/- 9 years, mean +/- standard deviation) were each rigidly fixed to a custom shoulder-testing device. A pneumatic system was used with pulleys and cables to simulate the rotator cuff and the deltoid muscles (anterior and middle portions). The glenohumeral joint was then positioned in the apprehension position of abduction, external rotation, and horizontal abduction. A 6-degree-of-freedom load cell (Assurance Technologies, Garner, North Carolina) measured the joint reaction force that was then resolved into three orthogonal components of compression force, anteriorly directed force, and superiorly directed force. With the use of a thrust bearing, the humerus was moved along a rail with a servomotor-controlled system at 50 mm/s that resulted in horizontal abduction. Force that developed passively in the pectoralis major muscle was recorded with an independent uniaxial load cell. Each of the glenohumeral joints dislocated anterior-inferior, six with avulsion of the capsulolabrum from the anterior-inferior glenoid bone and eight with capsulolabral stretching. Pectoralis major muscle force as well as the joint reaction force increased with horizontal abduction until dislocation. At dislocation, the magnitude of the pectoralis major muscle force, 609.6 N +/- 65.2 N was similar to the compression force, 569.6 N +/- 37.8 N. A cadaveric model yielded an anterior dislocation with a mechanism of forcible apprehension positioning when the appropriate shoulder muscles were simulated and a passive pectoralis major muscle was included.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this paper was to analyze outcomes in patients at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) who presented with contusion-stretch injuries to the axillary nerve. These injuries resulted from shoulder injury either with or without fracture/dislocation. Although recovery of deltoid function can occur spontaneously, this was not always the case.Severe deficits persisting for several months led the patients to undergo surgery. Operative categories included isolated axillary palsy (56 procedures), combined axillary and suprascapular palsies (11 procedures), axillary and radial palsies (14 procedures), and axillary palsy with another deficit, usually infraclavicular plexus loss (20 procedures). Deltoid function was evaluated pre- and postoperatively by applying the LSUHSC grading system. An anterior infraclavicular approach was usually followed during surgery, but in three patients an additional posterior approach was used. Axillary lesions usually began in the proximal portion of the posterior cord. Although several patients had distraction of the nerve, lesions in continuity were found in more than 90% of cases. Intraoperative nerve action potential (NAP) recordings were performed to determine the need for resection. Most repairs were made using grafts, although in three patients with relatively focal lesions suture was used. When an NAP was recorded across the lesion and neurolysis was performed, recovery was judged to be a mean Grade 4 according to the LSUHSC in 30 cases. Recovery following suture repairs was a mean Grade 3.8, whereas recovery after 66 graft repairs was a mean Grade 3.7. In cases in which suprascapular palsies were associated with axillary injuries, the former recovered but the latter did not necessarily do so without surgery. If the radial nerve was also injured, recovery of the triceps and brachioradialis muscles and wrist extension was usually obtained, but it was far more difficult to reverse the loss of finger and thumb extension. Although few in number, complications did occur and they are important.Operative exploration of axillary contusion-stretch lesions is worthwhile in carefully selected cases. If indicated by inspection and intraoperative electrical studies, nerve repair can lead to useful function.",

Knowledge of the position of the glenohumeral rotational centre and of the deltoid muscle length is essential to understand optimal placement of a total shoulder prosthesis.This study is designed to analyse the effect of deltoid muscle elongation on shoulder joint function.A three-dimensional model of the glenohumeral joint with deltoid muscle analysis in the scapular plane.A geometrical three-dimensional ball-and-socket model of the shoulder joint was developed. From dry bones, the position of the origins and insertions of the three parts of the deltoid muscle relative to the calculated centre of rotation of the humeral head was defined. The position and the direction of the muscle force working lines relative to this humeral centre were calculated using former measurements and CT-data of the deltoid. Muscle length-tension data were applied to obtain angle-force relationships. The model was used to calculate the angle-force relationships, the moment arm and the moment of the deltoid muscle components for successive arm elevation angles in the scapular plane. These data were compared to those of a theoretical situation assuming a 10% elongation of the muscle.Muscle angle-force curves show a more favourable slope after moderate (10%) deltoid muscle elongation. Elongating the muscle by changing the distance between the humeral rotation point and the deltoid insertion along the humeral axis does not affect moment arms. The moments of the deltoid muscle forces themselves, however, seem more adapted to elevation in the scapular plane. The deltoid maximal moment exceeds the arm-weight moment by about 40% instead of being approximately equal, and that the maximum is situated around 100 degrees of elevation.From a biomechanical point of view, stretching the deltoid muscle by 10% seems to result in a significantly more favourable position in case of shoulder elevation at 90 degrees of abduction in the scapular plane in a centred glenohumeral joint.This model suggests that a 10% elongation of the deltoid muscle, the most important shoulder abductor, improves its ability to elevate the arm.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine cases of patients with impingement syndrome secondary to an unfused, unstable, os acromiale.Retrospective case series.Twelve consecutive patients (13 shoulders) presented with impingement symptoms in the presence of an os acromiale. The os acromiale, at the meso-acromion level, was seen on standard radiographs. The patients were all treated conservatively with rotator cuff strengthening, stretching, anti-inflammatory medications, and steroid injections. All patients underwent an impingement test with lidocaine, resulting in complete relief of their pain. After failure of the conservative management, the 12 patients (13 shoulders) underwent an extended arthroscopic subacromial decompression. The goal of the modified arthroscopic acromioplasty was resection of adequate bone to remove the mobile anterior acromial tip. In general, this consisted of more bony resection than the typical arthroscopic acromioplasty. Postoperatively, the patients began a rehabilitation program emphasizing early range of motion followed by isolated free-weight rotator cuff strengthening exercises. Five shoulders had a partial-thickness tear of the rotator cuff. Four involved less than 50% of the thickness of the rotator cuff. These 4 partial-thickness tears underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement. One partial-thickness tear was greater than 50% and repair was performed with a mini-open deltoid-splitting technique.Results were evaluated using UCLA shoulder scoring. Preoperatively, the score averaged 17. The 3-month postoperative score was 27, and at 6 and 12 months, averaged 28. The final follow-up score averaged 31. There were 11 satisfactory results with UCLA scores >/=28. Two unsatisfactory results showed UCLA scores in the fair category. Full strength of the anterior deltoid and rotator cuff muscles was achieved in all patients by 6 months postoperatively as evaluated by manual muscle testing. Twelve of the 13 shoulders were rated by the patients as having a satisfactory result. All of the patients rated their cosmetic results as acceptable. There was no evidence of postoperative deltoid detachment. No patient developed pain at the pseudarthrosis point.Given the previously reported poor results with attempts at fusion of an unstable os acromiale and open complete excision of meso-acromial fragments, the authors conclude that an extended arthroscopic subacromial decompression results in a reasonable outcome for patients with impingement syndromes secondary to an unstable os acromiale.",

          "abstract": "To evaluate the role, the difficulties of rehabilitation and to diagnose the eventual surgical complications after shoulder prosthesis for 4-part fractures.Forty three patients (46 shoulders) who underwent shoulder arthroplasty after fracture of the proximal humerus underwent rehabilitation and follow-up at a special reeducation center for an average of 3 months (1 to 6). There were 42 four-part fractures (with 22 fracture-dislocation) and 4 three-part fractures. The patients were send by five different hospitals and have all been operated by senior surgeons. Three types of implants were used: the Modular Shoulder prosthesis (27 cases), the Global prosthesis (2 cases), and the Aequalis prosthesis (17 cases). The rehabilitation followed the protocol recommended by Neer (recovery of passive joint movements, muscular strengthening and stretching) to which were added hydrotherapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Forty patients (43 épaules) were reviewed and radiographed with an average follow-up of 29 months (18 to 72 months).The functional results were disappointing with a normalised Constant score of only 60.2 per cent and an average active elevation of only 96 degrees. There appeared to be two factors which explained these poor results. Firstly, the advanced age of the population (52 per cent older than 70) who was often poorly or non-motivated (22 per cent) and debilitated (21 per cent chronic alcoholics) and who had significant medical and neuro-psychiatric histories. Secondly, incompletely resolved anatomical and surgical problems: damage to the circumflex nerve (6.5 per cent), early migration of the greater tuberosity (6.5 per cent), secondary migration with malunion (15 per cent) and/or nonunion (11 per cent) of the greater tuberosity. Migration of the greater tuberosity should be suspected clinically in three circumstances: 1) in patients who have an abnormally painful shoulder in the immediate post-operative period (16 cases in our series); 2) when there is no progression (24 per cent) or regression (9 per cent) of active shoulder mobility after three months of correct supervised rehabilitation; 3) later, if there is a dissociation between active anterior elevation (deficient) and passive anterior elevation (preserved).The age and poor general condition of the patients as well as the difficulty of the surgical technique more than the rehabilitation, explain the disappointing results observed after shoulder prosthesis for four-part fractures. The discrepancy between active and passive elevation suggests that limited motion is not caused by a stiff shoulder because of glenohumeral scarring but instead by weakness of the deltoid (because of axillary lesion) and/or of the external rotators (because of greater tuberosity migration). There is some discordance between the necessity to early mobilise the shoulder and the high rate of tuberosity migration.",

          "abstract": "Co-contraction of antagonist muscles is characteristic of spasticity arising from perinatal brain damage but not in spasticity occurring after brain damage in adulthood. Such co-contraction is a normal feature of early post-natal motor development. Heteronymous, monosynaptic Group Ia projections from biceps brachii to both the antagonist triceps brachii and to other synergist and non-synergist muscles of the upper limb occur in the newborn baby and become restricted during the first 4 years to motor neurons of primarily synergistic muscles. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have been performed to test the hypothesis that inappropriate heteronymous excitatory projections persist in children with perinatal brain damage who develop spasticity. Subjects with spasticity, from brain damage acquired in adulthood were also studied to determine if these projections simply become unmasked as part of spasticity, independent of the age of occurrence of the brain damage. Twenty-nine healthy newborn babies and 29 at high risk for cerebral palsy, 12 of whom developed spastic quadriparesis, were studied longitudinally for 4 years. Thirty-eight subjects, aged 8-30 years, with spasticity of perinatal origin (11 hemiplegic, 11 quadriplegic, 16 with Rett syndrome) and 11 subjects with stroke in adulthood and spastic hemiplegia were also studied. The results were compared with those obtained in 372 normal subjects aged from birth to 55 years. Small taps were delivered to the tendon of biceps brachii using an electromechanical tapper. Surface EMG was recorded from biceps and triceps brachii, pectoralis major and deltoid. In the longitudinal study, those developing spastic quadriparesis showed persistent low thresholds for the homonymous phasic stretch reflex, which had abnormally short onset latencies. There was persistence of short onset heteronymous excitatory responses in triceps brachii, while a normal pattern of restriction of heteronymous responses to pectoralis major and deltoid occurred. The same pattern was observed in older subject groups with spasticity of perinatal origin. In adults with hemiplegia following stroke the threshold of the homonymous phasic stretch reflex was low, but it had a normal onset latency. There was no evidence of abnormal heteronymous excitatory responses. In conclusion, exaggerated excitatory responses to primary muscle afferent input were observed in the homonymous (biceps brachii) and antagonist (triceps brachii) motor neurons in subjects with spasticity arising from perinatal brain damage. They are likely to play an important role in the predominant co-contraction of agonist/antagonist muscles during voluntary movement observed in subjects with spastic cerebral palsy.",

          "abstract": "The authors have reviewed 67 axillary nerve lesions from 1987 to 1993. 35 times the lesion was isolated; 20 times it was associated to other nerve lesions (9 times supra scapular nerve, 3 times musculocutaneous nerve, 8 times posterior cord) and 12 times lesions were associated to rotator cuff injury.Injury corresponded 9 times to stretching mechanism in upper limb traction and came 58 times with osteoarticular lesions (30 anterior dislocations and 28 shoulder fractures). In 11 cases, shoulder active abduction was normal, inspite of deltoïd's complete palsy and this accounted for diagnosis delay. Concerning axillary nerve isolated lesions (35 cases), 7 recovered spontaneously and 28 have been operated. Surgical operation was undertaken 9 months after injury using a combined anterior and posterior approach. Rupture was located in the quadrilateral space and 23 nerve grafts, 4 neurolysis and 1 direct suture were performed. Results were good (muscle measured to M4) and excellent (muscle measured to M5) in 57 per cent of cases. Concerning axillary nerve lesions associated to suprascapular nerve lesions (9 cases) and musculocutaneous nerve (3 cases), all axillary nerve lesions were grafted with 50 per cent of good and very good results. The scapular nerve was neurolysed 6 times with 4 good and excellent results and evaluated irreparable in 3 cases. Musculocutaneous nerve was grafted in all cases with 2 good results out of 3. Posterior cord lesions (8 cases) required an osteotomy of the clavicle. Five grafts and 3 neurolysis were performed with aleatory results. At last, when associated lesions of the rotator cuff muscle were found (12 cases), 6 cases recovered spontaneously and 3 times cuff rupture was small enough to be reinserted with 2 good results. The 6 other cases corresponded to an axillary nerve rupture which were all grafted with 2 good results. On the cuff, result was in relation with lesion's type. Twice a supraspinatus tendon rupture was reinserted with 1 good result and 1 fair result. In 3 older patients, there was a small size rupture which has been reinserted with 1 good result, 1 fair result and 1 failure. At last, one surgical repair of a large rupture couldn't be justified.These encouraging results suggest to propose repair of axillary nerve when deltoid muscle palsy does not recover until 3 to 6 months. Rupture diagnosis is then suspected and the best surgical technique is a nerve graft.",

          "abstract": "30 competitive volleyball attackers of the German third league, 15 with shoulder pain (group I) and 15 without shoulder pain (group II) were examined clinically and sonographically. Anamnesis was also carried out. The results were compared with those of a control of 15 non-volleyball players not subject to stress caused by overhead use of their arms. On the visual analog scale the average pain was 5.1 (SD 1.4). The average history of pain was 2.7 (SD 2.7) years. Cause for the pain was \"spiking without warming up\" (n = 7) or \"unknown\" (n = 8). Spiking respectively serving caused new pain sensation in 14 (11) attackers. Players of group I stretched shorter than those of group II. Pain was located laterally to the greater tuberculum (n = 8), at the origin of the deltoid muscle (n = 3), at the bicipital groove (n = 2) or in the area of the ventral glenoid (n = 2). Pain was caused by active anteversion above 160 degrees (n = 3), active abduction above 140 degrees (n = 2) or both (n = 10). The playing shoulder was depressed in all 30 volleyball attackers. By measuring the distance from the epicondylus radii to the acromion of the other side by maximal forced horizontal adduction, the distance from the margo medialis scapula to the spine, the distance from the tip of middle finger to the lumbar spine by maximal internal rotation of the shoulder up the back showed significant differences between both sides and between the groups. The spiking arm scapula is significantly lateralised compared to the opposite side and compared to sportsmen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Both groups received conventional physical therapy. The experimental group received additional FES therapy where two flaccid/paralyzed shoulder muscles (supraspinatus and posterior deltoid) were induced to contract repetitively up to 6 hours a day for 6 weeks. Duration of both the FES session and muscle contraction/relaxation ratio were progressively increased as performance improved. The experimental group showed significant improvements in arm function, electromyographic activity of the posterior deltoid, range of motion, and reduction in subluxation (as indicated by x-ray) compared with the control group.

The former usually goes on to a full recovery whereas a failure to recover is common in the latter group. In our review of 13 patients with palsy after blunt shoulder trauma, seven patients showed minimal or no recovery of deltoid muscle function and six patients went on to complete or near complete recovery. Serial electromyographic examinations usually revealed the lesion to be in continuity although eventual clinical recovery was not satisfactory in a number of these patients. The mechanism of the palsy appeared to involve a stretch injury and this was confirmed at operation in two patients.

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate deep tendon reflex responses and associated electrophysiological parameters of the muscles in patients with fibromyalgia. This cross-sectional study included 38 patients with fibromyalgia and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. Deep tendon reflexes of the rectus femoris and triceps brachii were tested using a reflex hammer. Electromyographic (amplitude and duration of activation), inertial measurement unit (angular velocity, acceleration), and electromechanical (delay) analyses were performed using a surface electromyography (sEMG) device. Comparative analyses were carried out between patients and controls. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of hyperreflexia in distinguishing fibromyalgia patients from controls. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the right/left rectus femoris and/or triceps brachii were observed in more than 85% (ranging from 86.8 to 94.7%) of the fibromyalgia group. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibited significantly increased deep tendon reflex responses compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients revealed significantly higher amplitude, longer duration of muscle activation, greater sagittal acceleration and angular velocity, and shorter electromechanical delay. Normalized muscle activation (right and left rectus femoris and right triceps brachii) in response to deep tendon reflex test showed acceptable ability in differentiating fibromyalgia patients from controls (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.890, 0.784 and 0.782, respectively). For the right rectus femoris, values ≤ 28.3 (clinically corresponding to normoactive/hypoactive deep tendon reflexes) appeared to rule-out fibromyalgia with 94.1% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity. Patients with fibromyalgia exhibit increased deep tendon reflex responses. Normal or decreased deep tendon reflex responses may probably be used as a rule-out criterion for fibromyalgia.© 2025.

          "abstract": "The subject-specific range of motion (RoM) of a musculoskeletal joint system is balanced by pre-tension levels of individual muscles, which affects their contraction capability. Such an inherent pre-tension or pre-stretch of muscles is not measureable with in vivo experiments. Using a 3D continuum mechanical forward simulation approach for motion analysis of the musculoskeletal system of the forearm with 3 flexor and 2 extensor muscles, we developed an optimization process to determine the muscle fibre pre-stretches for an initial arm position, which is given human dataset. We used RoM values of a healthy person to balance the motion in extension and flexion. The performed sensitivity study shows that the fibre pre-stretches of the m. brachialis, m. biceps brachii and m. triceps brachii with 91 % dominate the objective flexion ratio, while m. brachiradialis and m. anconeus amount 7.8 % and 1.2 % . Within the multi-dimensional space of the surrogate model, 3D sub-spaces of primary variables, namely the dominant muscles and the global objective, flexion ratio, exhibit a path of optimal solutions. Within this optimal path, the muscle fibre pre-stretch of two flexors demonstrate a negative correlation, while, in contrast, the primary extensor, m. triceps brachii correlates positively to each of the flexors. Comparing the global optimum with four other designs along the optimal path, we saw large deviations, e.g., up to 15 ∘ in motion and up to 40% in muscle force. This underlines the importance of accurate determination of fibre pre-stretch in muscles, especially, their role in pathological muscular disorders and surgical applications such as free muscle or tendon transfer.© 2024.

          "abstract": "First described in 1875 by Wilhelm Heinrich Erb and Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal, the deep tendon reflex (DTR) is essential in examining and diagnosing neurologic disease. Deep tendon reflexes or, more accurately, the 'muscle stretch reflex' can aid in evaluating neurologic disease affecting afferent nerves, spinal cord synaptic connections, motor nerves, and descending motor pathways. Proper technique and interpretation of results are crucial in achieving a proper distinction between upper and lower motor neuron pathologic processes such as multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injuries, and spinal muscular atrophies, with the presence of hyporeflexia or hyperreflexia considered a 'hard sign' of neurologic dysfunction. There are five primary deep tendon reflexes: biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, patellar, and ankle. Biceps Reflex: Muscle involved: biceps brachii. Nerve supply: musculocutaneous. Segmental innervation: C5-C6. Brachioradialis Reflex: Muscle involved: brachioradialis. Nerve supply: radial. Segmental innervation: C5-C6. Triceps Reflex: Muscle involved: triceps brachii. Nerve supply: radial . Segmental innervation: C7-C8. Patellar Reflex (knee-jerk): Muscle involved: quadriceps femoris. Nerve supply: femoral. Segmental innervation: L2-L4. Achilles Reflex (ankle-jerk): Muscles involved: gastrocnemius, soleus. Nerve supply: tibial. Segmental innervation: S1-S2. To provide a standard scale for evaluating deep tendon reflexes, in 1993, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) proposed a grading scale from 0 to 4. This scale has been validated and is universally accepted. NINDS grading of deep tendon reflexes. 0: Reflex absent. 1: Reflex small, less than normal, includes a trace response or a response brought out only with reinforcement. 2: Reflex in the lower half of a normal range. 3: Reflex in the upper half of a normal range. 4: Reflex enhanced, more than normal, includes clonus if present, which optionally can be noted in an added verbal description of the reflex. In some instances, a plus sign (+) is written after the number. When discussing DTRs, adding or omitting a plus sign does not change the meaning of the reflex grade observed. What is 'normal' typically depends on the patient's history and past documented reflex grade. Abnormality is suggested when asymmetric reflexes are found. Once the examiner obtains a reflex on one side, they should test the same reflex on the opposite side for comparison.Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

          "abstract": "Aponeurosis is a sheath-like connective tissue that aids in force transmission from muscle to tendon and can be found throughout the musculoskeletal system. The key role of aponeurosis in muscle-tendon unit mechanics is clouded by a lack of understanding of aponeurosis structure-function properties. This work aimed to determine the heterogeneous material properties of porcine triceps brachii aponeurosis tissue with materials testing and evaluate heterogeneous aponeurosis microstructure with scanning electron microscopy. We found that aponeurosis may exhibit more microstructural collagen waviness in the insertion region (near the tendon) compared to the transition region (near the muscle midbelly) (1.20 versus 1.12, p = 0.055), which and a less stiff stress-strain response in the insertion versus transition regions (p < 0.05). We also showed that different assumptions of aponeurosis heterogeneity, specifically variations in elastic modulus with location can alter the stiffness (by more than 10x) and strain (by approximately 10% muscle fiber strain) of a finite element model of muscle and aponeurosis. Collectively, these results suggest that aponeurosis heterogeneity could be due to variations in tissue microstructure and that different approaches to modeling tissue heterogeneity alters the behavior of computational models of muscle-tendon units. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Aponeurosis is a connective tissue found in many muscle tendon units that aids in force transmission, yet little is known about the specific material properties of aponeurosis. This work aimed to determine how the properties of aponeurosis tissue varied with location. We found that aponeurosis exhibits more microstructural waviness near the tendon compared to near the muscle midbelly, which was associated with differences in tissue stiffness. We also showed that different variations in aponeurosis modulus (stiffness) can alter the stiffness and stretch of a computer model of muscle tissue. These results show that assuming uniform aponeurosis structure and modulus, which is common, may lead to inaccurate models of the musculoskeletal system.Copyright © 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.

          "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of resistance training (RT) with inter-set static stretching (IS) versus traditional RT (TRT) on morphofunctional outcomes in recreationally resistance-trained male and female. Methods: Twenty-two recreationally-trained subjects were allocated to IS group (n = 12) or TRT (n = 10) and completed eight weeks of RT. The only difference between the groups was that IS group included static stretching between sets, while the TRT rested between the sets. Ultrasound images, dynamic and isometric strength tests for the elbow flexors and elbow extensors were evaluated pre- and post-intervention period. Results: Total training volume (TTV) was greater in TRT than IS (p = .031). TRT and IS caused similar increases in maximal dynamic and isometric strength. Fascicle length of the brachialis increased following TRT (p = .033); muscle thickness and the pennation angle of the distal portion of the triceps brachii increased following IS (p = .035 and p = .007, respectively). There were no significant changes in thickness and architecture for biceps brachii in either group. There were no significant differences between groups for any muscle strength and morphology outcome. Conclusion: IS negatively affects TTV but does not affect muscle strength and architecture of recreationally resistance-trained male and female.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have reported that transcutaneous spinal stimulation (tSCS) may facilitate improved upper limb motor function in those with incomplete tetraplesia. However, little is known about how tSCS engages upper limb motor pools. This study aimed to explore the extent to which discrete upper limb motor pools can be selectively engaged via altering stimulus location and intensity. 14 participants with intact nervous systems completed two test visits, during which posterior root-muscle reflexes (PRMR) were evoked via a 3x3 cathode matrix applied over the cervicothoracic spine. An incremental recruitment curve at C7 vertebral level was initially performed to attain minimal threshold intensity (MTI) in each muscle. Paired pulses (1ms square monophasic with inter-pulse interval of 50ms) were subsequently delivered at a frequency of 0.25Hz at two intensities (MTI and [Formula: see text]) across all nine locations. in a random order. Evoked response to the 1st (PRMR1) and 2nd (PRMR2) stimuli were recorded from four upper limb muscles. A significant effect of spinal level was observed in all muscles for PRMR1 with greater responses recorded more caudally. Unexpectedly, contralateral cathode placement significantly increased PRMR1 in Biceps Brachii (P=0.012), Flexor Carpi Radialis (P=0.035) and Abductor Pollicis Brevis (P=0.001). Post-activation depression (PAD) was also significantly increased with contralateral cathode placement in Biceps Brachii (P=0.001), Triceps Brachii (P=0.012) and Flexor Carpi Radialis (P=0.001). These results suggest that some level of unilateral motor pool selectivity may be attained via altering stimulus intensity and location during cervicothoracic tSCS.",

However, even completely isometric muscle-tendon units have the potential to act as tension struts, forming links in linkages that avoid the demand for mechanical work-cycling in the first place. Here, forelimb and hindlimb structures and geometries of quadrupeds are considered in terms of linkages that avoid mechanical work at the level of both the whole limb and the individual muscles. The scapula, isometric serratus muscles and forelimb can be viewed as a modified Roberts' straight-line mechanism that supports an approximately horizontal path of the body with vertically orientated forces, resulting in low work demand at the level of both limb and muscle. Modelled isometric triceps brachii inserting to the olecranon form part of a series of four-bar linkages (forelimb) and isometric biceps femoris cranial, rectus femoris and tensor fascia latae form part of a series of six-bar linkages (hindlimb), in both cases potentially resulting in straight-line horizontal motion, generating appropriate moments about shoulder and hip to maintain vertical ground reaction forces and again low mechanical work demand from the limb.

The experiment was divided into two sessions. In the extension perturbation session, participants either relaxed or flexed the elbow when they felt a perturbation (abrupt elbow extension induced by a dynamometer). This was done 30 times by each subject for both sessions. In the flexion perturbation session, participants also relaxed or extended the elbow when they felt a perturbation (abrupt elbow flexion). During the tasks, the stretch reflex was monitored by recording the surface EMG activities of the right biceps and triceps brachii. The EMG reflex components were divided into three periods based on the time after the perturbation (M1, 20-50 ms; M2, 50-80 ms; and M3, 80-100 ms). The averaged background EMG activity just before the disturbance was subtracted from the EMG activity in each period. The resultant value was integrated to obtain reflex magnitudes of M1 to M3.For the triceps brachii, in the relaxation task, the wrestler group showed a significantly smaller value for M2 than did the control group. In the extension task, the wrestler group showed a significantly larger value for M3 than did the control group. There was no difference in M1 between the two groups. For the biceps brachii, there was no significant difference between any reflex components.Our results suggest that high-level wrestlers have specific characteristics of the long-latency stretch reflex in the triceps brachii that are modulated in a situation-specific manner.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

          "abstract": "There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The EMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grade for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community, and home-based rehabilitation.",

J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1286-1294, 2019-The acute response to and long-term effects of partial range of motion exercise (PRE) and full range of motion exercise (FRE) of elbow extensors were compared in young trained men. The PRE was expected to increase the intramuscular hypoxic environment, which was theorized to enhance muscular hypertrophy. Forty-four resistance-trained men were divided into 2 training groups, PRE (n = 22) or FRE (n = 22) group, and performed the PRE or FRE acute exercise protocol. The PRE (elbow range from 45° to 90°) and FRE (from 0° to 120°) acute protocols consisted of 3 sets of 8 repetitions, with an 8RM, and an equivalent workload. After the initial testing, the training program for each group, comprised 3 training sessions per week for 8 weeks, was started. The acute responses of area under the oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) curve, blood lactate concentration, and root mean square of electromyography were significantly higher both before and after PRE than FRE training. Long-term effects were produced by both PRE and FRE, with significant (p ≤ 0.05) increases in cross-sectional area (CSA) of triceps brachii and isometric strength. The CSA increased significantly greater after PRE (48.7 ± 14.5%) than after FRE (28.2 ± 10.9%). Furthermore, during the PRE program, a positive correlation was detected between the percent increase in CSA and area under the Oxy-Hb curves before and after 8-week exercise training (before 8-week exercise training: r = 0.59, after 8-week exercise training: r = 0.70, p < 0.01). These results suggest that intramuscular hypoxia might facilitate muscular hypertrophy with PRE being more effective than FRE.",

Interset stretching vs. traditional strength training: effects on muscle strength and size in untrained individuals. J Strength Cond Res 33(7S): S159-S166, 2019-This study compared the effects of 8 weeks of traditional strength training (TST) and interset stretching (ISS) combined with TST on muscular adaptations. Twenty-nine sedentary, healthy adults were randomly assigned to either the TST (n = 17; 28.0 ± 6.4 years) or ISS (n = 12; 26.8 ± 6.1 years) group. Both groups performed 6 strength exercises encompassing the whole body (bench press, elbow extension, seated rows, biceps curl, knee extension, and knee flexion) performing 4 sets of 8-12 repetition maximum (RM) with a 90-second rest between sets. However, the ISS group performed static passive stretching, at maximum amplitude, for 30 seconds between sets. Both groups performed training sessions twice a week on nonconsecutive days. Muscle strength (i.e., 1RM) and hypertrophy (i.e., muscle thickness [MT] by ultrasonography) were measured at pre-test and after 8 weeks of training. Both groups increased 1RM bench press (p ≤ 0.0001): ISS (23.4%, CIdiff: 4.3 kg-11.1 kg) and TST (22.2%, CIdiff: 5.2 kg-10.9 kg) and 1RM knee extension (p ≤ 0.0001): ISS (25.5%, CIdiff: 5.6 kg-15.0 kg) and TST (20.6%, CIdiff: 4.4 kg-12.3 kg). Both groups increased MT of biceps brachii (BIMT), triceps brachii (TRMT), and rectus femoris (RFMT) (p ≤ 0.0001). BIMT: ISS (7.2%, CIdiff: 1.14-3.5 mm) and TST (4.7%, CIdiff: 0.5-2.5 mm), TRMT: ISS (12.3%, CIdiff: 1.1-4.4 mm) and TST (7.1%, CIdiff: 0.3-3.1 mm), and RFMT: ISS (12.4%, CIdiff: 1.1-2.9 mm) and TST (9.1%, CIdiff: 0.7-2.2 mm). For vastus lateralis muscle thickness (VLMT) and sum of the 4 muscle thickness sites (ΣMT), there was a significant group by time interaction (p ≤ 0.02) in which ISS increased VLMT and ΣMT to a greater extent than TST. Vastus lateralis muscle thickness: ISS (17.0%, CIdiff: 1.5-3.1 mm) and TST (7.3%, CIdiff: 0.7-2.1 mm), and ΣMT: ISS (10.5%, CIdiff: 6.5-9.0 mm) and TST (6.7%, CIdiff: 3.9-8.3 mm). Although our findings might suggest a benefit of adding ISS into TST for optimizing muscle hypertrophy, our data are not sufficient enough to conclude that ISS is superior to TST for inducing muscle hypertrophic adaptations. More studies are warranted to elucidate the effects of ISS compared with TST protocols on skeletal muscle. However, our findings support that adding ISS to regular TST regimens does not compromise muscular adaptations during the early phase of training (<8 weeks) in untrained individuals.",

          "abstract": "By following the common definition of forward-dynamics simulations, i.e. predicting movement based on (neural) muscle activity, this work describes, for the first time, a forward-dynamics simulation framework of a musculoskeletal system, in which all components are represented as continuous, three-dimensional, volumetric objects. Within this framework, the mechanical behaviour of the entire muscle-tendon complex is modelled as a nonlinear hyperelastic material undergoing finite deformations. The feasibility and the full potential of the proposed forward-dynamics simulation framework is demonstrated on a two-muscle, three-dimensional, continuum-mechanical model of the upper limb. The musculoskeletal model consists of three bones, i.e. humerus, ulna, and radius, an one-degree-of-freedom elbow joint, and an antagonistic muscle pair, i.e. the biceps and triceps brachii, and takes into consideration the contact between the skeletal muscles and the humerus. Numerical studies have shown that the proposed upper limb model is capable of predicting realistic moment arms and muscle forces for the entire range of activation and motion. Within the limitations of the model, the presented simulations provide, for the first time, insights into existing contact forces and their influence on the muscle fibre stretch. Based on the presented simulations, the overall change in fibre stretch is typically less than 3%, despite the fact that the contact forces reach up to 71% of the exerted muscle force. Movement-predicting simulations are achieved by minimising a nonlinear moment equilibrium equation. Based on the forward-dynamics simulation approach, an iterative solution procedures for position-driven (inverse dynamics) and force-driven scenarios have been proposed accordingly. Applying these methodologies to time-dependent scenarios demonstrates that the proposed methods can be linked to state-of-the-art control algorithms predicting time-dependent muscle activation levels based on principles of forward dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Essential tremor is an involuntary trembling of body limbs in people without tremor-related disease. In previous study, suppression of tremor by sensory electrical stimulation was confirmed on the index finger. This study investigates the effect of sensory stimulation on multiple segments and joints of the upper limb. It denotes the observation regarding the effect's continuity after halting the stimulation. 18 patients with essential tremor (8 men and 10 women) participated in this study. The task, \"arms stretched forward\", was performed and sensory electrical stimulation was applied on four muscles of the upper limb (Flexor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Radialis, Biceps Brachii, and Triceps Brachii) for 15 seconds. Three 3-D gyro sensors were used to measure the angular velocities of segments (finger, hand, and forearm) and joints (metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints) for three phases of pre-stimulation (Pre), during-stimulation (On), and 5 minute post-stimulation (P5). Three characteristic variables of root-mean-squared angular velocity, peak power, and peak power frequency were derived from the vector sum of the sensor signals. At On phase, RMS velocity was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints while peak power was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints except for forearm segment. Sensory stimulation showed no effect on peak power frequency. All variables at P5 were similar to those at On at all segments and joints. The decrease of peak power of the index finger was noted by 90% during stimulation from that of On phase, which was maintained even after 5 min. The results indicate that sensory stimulation may be an effective clinical method to treat the essential tremor.",

          "abstract": "Clonus is involuntary and rhythmic muscle contractions caused by a permanent lesion in descending motor neurons. Clonus may be found at the ankle, patella, triceps surae, wrist, jaw, biceps brachii. In general, clonus may occur in any muscle with a frequency of 5-8 Hz and the average period of oscillations of the ankle clonus is approximately 160-200 ms. Plantar flexion (PF) comprises 45% of the period, dorsifleksion (DF) comprises 55% of the period. The first beat is always longer, with the time shortening in continuing beats and becoming stable in the 4th or 5th period. The exact mechanism of clonus remains unclear. Two different hypotheses have been asserted regarding the development of clonus. The most widely accepted explanation is that hyperactive stretch reflexes in clonus are caused by self-excitation. Another alternative explanation for clonus is central generator activity that arises as a consequence of appropriate peripheral events and produces rhythmic stimulation of the lower motor neurons. The durations of clonus burst were found longer than the durations of Soleus medium-latency reflex (MLR). There is a similarity in their nature, although the speed and cause of the stretch of triceps surae differ in the MLR and the clonus, and there is a sufficient period of time for group II afferents and for other spinal mechanisms to be involved in the clonus, together with Ia afferents. Clonus can be treated by using baclofen, applying cold, botox or phenol injections.",

          "abstract": "This investigation was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of stretch-shortening cycling (SSC(EFF)) in upper-limb extensor muscles while cross-country skiing using the double-poling technique (DP). To this end, SSC(EFF) was analyzed in relation to DP velocity and performance. Eleven elite cross-country skiers performed an incremental test to determine maximal DP velocity (V(max)). Thereafter, cycle characteristics, elbow joint kinematics and poling forces were monitored on a treadmill while skiing at two sub-maximal and racing velocity (85% of V(max)). The average EMG activities of the triceps brachii and latissimus dorsi muscles were determined during the flexion and extension sub-phases of the poling cycle (EMG(FLEX), EMG(EXT)), as well as prior to pole plant (EMG(PRE)). SSC(EFF) was defined as the ratio of aEMG(FLEX) to aEMG(EXT). EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) increased with velocity for both muscles (P < 0.01), as did SSC(EFF) (from 0.9 ± 0.3 to 1.3 ± 0.5 for the triceps brachii and from 0.9 ± 0.4 to 1.5 ± 0.5 for the latissimus dorsi) and poling force (from 253 ± 33 to 290 ± 36N; P < 0.05). Furthermore, SSC(EFF) was positively correlated to Vmax, to EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) (P < 0.05). The neuromuscular adaptations made at higher velocities, when more poling force must be applied to the ground, exert a major influence on the DP performance of elite cross-country skiers.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Cinematic parameters have been recorded using a system of motion 3D video analysis, a kinematic model was build in accordance to standard protocols. The skin (native and straightened) electromyogram (EMG) was recorded synchronously with kinematic data using 16-channel electromyography from the following pairs of muscles: mm. sternocleido-mastoideus, trapezius (горизонтальная порция), biceps brachii, triceps brachii, rectus femoris, adductor magnus. Major differences in the EMG picture between patients and controls were: 1) the EMG \"monotony\" with the involvement of multiple additional muscles in locomotions with the prevalence of the peculiar \"tonic\" muscle activity (low amplitudes without distinct peaks), stretching along the whole cycle of movement. In controls, EMG demonstrated variability and had mostly \"phasic\" character with distinct 1 or 2 peaks; 2) the asymmetry of EMG profile in symmetric movements. i.e. when performed simultaneously from the right and from the left sides. The latter feature may be considered as predictive because it was never found in healthy people. It allows to identify objectively weak muscles even in the absence of visible parethis during the routine neurological examination.",

EMG activity and torque increased with incremental increase of angular velocities. The joint angle of maximal EMG activity according to different angular velocities did not show any significant difference (116°-127° in elbow extension and 37°-66° in elbow flexion). The joint angles of maximal torque according to different angular velocities were not significantly different either.Using the portable hand-driven isokinetic system on the elbows of normal subjects, we were able to obtain expected results.

          "abstract": "Torque motor produced stretch of upper limb muscles results in two distinct reflex peaks in the electromyographic activity. Whereas the short-latency reflex (SLR) response is mediated largely by the spinal monosynaptic reflex pathway, the longer-latency reflex (LLR) is suggested to involve a transcortical loop. For the SLRs, patterns of heteronymous monosynaptic Ia connections have been well-studied for a large number of muscles in the cat and in humans. For LLRs, information is available for perturbations to proximal joints, although the protocols for most of these studies did not focus on heteronymous connections. The main objective of the present study was to elicit both SLRs and LLRs in wrist flexors and extensors and to examine heteronymous connections from these muscles to elbow flexors (biceps brachii; BiBr) and extensors (triceps brachii; TriBr) and to selected distal muscles, including abductor pollicis longus (APL), first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and Thenars. The stretch of wrist flexors produced SLR and LLR peaks in APL, FDI, ADM, Thenars, and BiBr while simultaneously inducing inhibition of wrist extensors and TriBr. When wrist extensors were stretched, SLR and LLR peaks were observed in TriBr, whereas the primary wrist flexors, APL and BiBr, were inhibited; response patterns of FDI, ADM, and Thenars were less consistent. The main conclusions from the observed data are that: 1) as in the cat, afferents from wrist flexors and extensors make heteronymous connections with proximal and distal upper limb muscles; and 2) the strength of heteronymous connections is greater for LLRs than SLRs in the distal muscles, whereas the opposite is true for the proximal muscles. In the majority of observations, SLR and LLR excitatory peaks were observed together. However, on occasion, LLRs were observed without the SLR response in hand muscles when wrist extensors were stretched.",

          "abstract": "The roles of muscles that span a single joint (monoarticular) versus those that span two (biarticular) or more joints have been suggested to differ. Monoarticular muscles are argued to perform work at a joint, whereas biarticular muscles are argued to transfer energy while resisting moments across adjacent joints. To test these predictions, in vivo patterns of muscle activation, strain, and strain rate were compared using electromyography and sonomicrometry in two major elbow extensors, the long and lateral heads of the triceps brachii of goats (Capra hircus), across a range of speed (1-5 m s(-1)) and gait. Muscle recordings were synchronized to limb kinematics using high-speed digital video imaging (250 Hz). Measurements obtained from four goats (25-45 kg) showed that the monoarticular lateral head exhibited a stretch-shortening pattern (6.8+/-0.6% stretch and -10.6+/-2.7% shortening; mean+/-s.e.m. for all speeds and gaits) after being activated, which parallels the flexion-extension pattern of the elbow. By contrast, the biarticular long head shortened through most of stance (-16.4+/-3.4%), despite elbow flexion in the first half and shoulder extension in the last half of stance. The magnitude of elbow flexion and shoulder extension increased with increasing speed (ANCOVA, P<0.05 and P<0.001), as did the magnitude and rate of active stretch of fascicles in the lateral head (P<0.001 for both). In all individuals, shortening fascicle strain rates increased with speed in the long head (P<0.001), and, in three of the four individuals, strain magnitude increased. Few independent effects of gait were found. In contrast to its expected function, the biarticular long head appears to produce positive work throughout stance, whereas the monoarticular lateral head appears to absorb work at the elbow. The biarticular anatomy of the long head may mitigate increases in muscle strain with speed in this muscle, because strain magnitude in the second phase of stance (when the shoulder extends) decreased with speed (P<0.05).",

          "abstract": "Neural coupling of proximal and distal upper limb segments may have functional implications in the recovery of hemiparesis after stroke. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the stretch reflex response magnitude of spastic finger flexor muscles poststroke is influenced by sensory input from the shoulder and the elbow and whether reflex coupling of muscles throughout the upper limb is altered in spastic stroke survivors. Through imposed extension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, stretch of the relaxed finger flexors of the four fingers was imposed in 10 relaxed stroke subjects under different conditions of proximal sensory input, namely static arm posture (3 different shoulder/elbow postures) and electrical stimulation (surface stimulation of biceps brachii or triceps brachii, or none). Fast (300 degrees/s) imposed stretch elicited stretch reflex flexion torque at the MCP joints and reflex electromyographic (EMG) activity in flexor digitorum superficialis. Both measures were greatest in an arm posture of 90 degrees of elbow flexion and neutral shoulder position. Biceps stimulation resulted in greater MCP stretch reflex flexion torque. Fast imposed stretch also elicited reflex EMG activity in nonstretched heteronymous upper limb muscles, both proximal and distal. These results suggest that in the spastic hemiparetic upper limb poststroke, sensorimotor coupling of proximal and distal upper limb segments is involved in both the increased stretch reflex response of the finger flexors and an increased reflex coupling of heteronymous muscles. Both phenomena may be mediated through changes poststroke in the spinal reflex circuits and/or in the descending influence of supraspinal pathways.",

Elbow angle, axial pole force and surface EMG in the triceps brachii, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and teres major muscle were recorded.

The mean MVC-normalized EMG amplitudes increased during the pre-activation phase before pole plant, elbow flexion and the reflex-mediated phase between 30 and 120 ms after pole plant due to velocity increases (P < 0.05).

We predicted that the strain and work patterns in the monoarticular lateral head would follow the kinematics and work of the elbow more closely than would those of the biarticular long head. In general this prediction was supported. For instance, the lateral head stretched (5 +/- 2%; mean +/- SE) in the lead and lag limbs to absorb work during elbow flexion and joint work absorption, while the long head shortened (-7 +/- 1%) to produce work. During elbow extension, both muscles shortened by similar amounts (-10 +/- 2% long; -13 +/- 4% lateral) in the lead limb to produce work. Both triceps heads functioned similarly in landing, stretching (13 +/- 3% in the long head and 19 +/- 5% in the lateral) to absorb energy. In general, the long head functioned to produce power at the shoulder and elbow, while the lateral head functioned to resist elbow flexion and absorb work, demonstrating that functional diversification can arise between mono- and biarticular muscle agonists operating at the same joint.",

The MGF gene expression increased significantly in both groups (by 1160% and 59%, respectively), and IGF-1 increased only in group A (by 335%). MyoD and myogenin gene expression increased in group A (by 107% and 94%, respectively) but did not change in group B.Response of growth and myogenic factors occurs during muscular adaptation to a prolonged training, and strength training with different strategies caused different responses with respect to gene expression of these factors. These results suggest that SC activation is involved in the muscular adaptation process to training and might be attributed to MHC isoform transition.",

          "abstract": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are Th2 cytokines involved in various immune responses and only a few reports examine skeletal muscle and the possible role of Th2 cytokines in myoblast fusion and myotube maturation. We hypothesized that IL-4, IL-13 and their receptors are involved in skeletal muscle adaptations to strength training. We investigated the effects of 6 weeks of strength training with different muscle load on IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1 expression in skeletal muscle: training with maximal contractions (Max group, n = 12) and training with lower load combined with ballistic and stretch-shortening contractions (Combi group, n = 12). Muscle samples were taken from triceps brachii before and after the 6 weeks of training. mRNA levels of IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1 expression were determined by real-time PCR and IL-4 protein expression by ELISA. We demonstrate for the first time that IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1 are expressed in skeletal muscle in vivo and are up-regulated after strength training. Higher training load in Max leads to higher cytokine responses, which was significant for IL-4Ralpha though IL-4 protein expression did not change significantly. Although the exact mechanisms have yet to be established, and these results may be preliminary, we speculate that IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1 are involved in muscle hypertrophy, MHC-transformation and anti-inflammatory damage control that occur during strength training.",

          "title": "Effects of physical training and detraining, immobilisation, growth and aging on human fascicle geometry.",
          "abstract": "In addition to its size and the extent of its neural activation, a muscle's geometry (the angles and lengths of its fibres or fascicles) strongly influences its force production characteristics. As with many other tissues within the body, muscle displays significant plasticity in its geometry. This review summarises geometric differences between various athlete populations and describes research examining the plasticity of muscle geometry with physical training, immobilisation/detraining, growth and aging. Typically, heavy resistance training in young adults has been shown to cause significant increases in fascicle angle of vastus lateralis and triceps brachii as measured by ultrasonography, while high-speed/plyometrics training in the absence of weight training has been associated with increases in fascicle length and a reduction in angles of vastus lateralis fascicles. These changes indicate that differences in geometry between various athletic populations might be at least partly attributable to their differing training regimes. Despite some inter-muscular differences, detraining/unloading is associated with decreases in fascicle angle, although little change was shown in muscles such as vastus lateralis and triceps brachii in studies examining the effects of prolonged bed rest. No research has examined the effects of other interventions such as endurance or chronic stretching training. Few data exist describing geometric adaptation during growth and maturation, although increases in gastrocnemius fascicle angle and length seem to occur until maturation in late adolescence. Although some evidence suggests that a decrease in both fascicle angle and length accompanies the normal aging process, there is a paucity of data examining the issue; heavy weight training might attenuate the decline, at least in fascicle length. A significant research effort is required to more fully understand geometric adaptation in response to physical training, immobilisation/detraining, growth and aging.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to investigate how quadriplegic patients with a C6-C7 spinal lesion coordinate their upper limb to extend the elbow despite the paralysis or weakness of the triceps brachii, and what is the effect of a surgical musculotendinous transfer. For this purpose, aiming movements in a wide workspace were recorded in seven healthy subjects and in patients with incomplete (five cases) or complete (eight cases) triceps paralysis and after musculotendinous transfer (eight cases). We used four electromagnetic field sensors to quantify hand trajectory and to compute the angles describing the rotations at the scapula, glenohumeral joint, elbow and wrist (10 degrees of freedom). Extent and smoothness of the hand trajectories and hand velocity profiles were surprisingly similar between healthy subjects and quadriplegic patients. The reduction of elbow extension observed in patients was compensated by rotations distributed across several degrees of freedom including the scapula. Principal components analysis showed that the joint rotations could be summarized by an additive combination of two synergies, respectively orientating and stretching out the limb, which explained similar amounts of variance in healthy subjects and in patients. The participations of degrees of freedom in the synergies were roughly similar in the different groups of subjects, the main difference concerning scapular medial-lateral rotation, which seems to be critical in patients with a complete triceps paralysis. This demonstrates that elbow extension in quadriplegic patients is due to anticipated mechanical interaction coupling between upper limb segments. We propose that the persisting (incomplete paralysis) or restored (musculotendinous transfer) elbow extensor strength may act by stabilizing the elbow. This counterintuitive preservation of limb kinematics for horizontal aiming movements in quadriplegic patients despite the drastic changes in muscle action provoked by paralysis and/or by surgery strongly suggests that the motor system does not primarily control forces but the morphological aspects of movement, via joint rotation synergies.",

          "abstract": "The neural mechanisms underlying the sense of joint position and movement remain controversial. While cutaneous receptors are known to contribute to kinesthesia for the fingers, the present experiments test the hypothesis that they contribute at other major joints. Illusory movements were evoked at the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the index finger, the elbow, and the knee by stimulation of populations of cutaneous and muscle spindle receptors, both separately and together. Subjects matched perceived movements with voluntary movements of homologous joints on the contralateral side. Cutaneous receptors were activated by stretch of the skin (using 2 intensities of stretch) and vibration activated muscle spindle receptors. Stimuli were designed to activate receptors that discharge during joint flexion. For the index finger, vibration was applied over the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hand, to evoke illusory metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion, and skin stretch was delivered around the IP joints. The strong skin stretch evoked the illusion of flexion of the proximal IP joint in 6/8 subjects (12 +/- 5 degrees, mean +/- SE). For the group, strong skin stretch delivered during vibration increased the perceived flexion of the proximal IP joint by eight times with a concomitant decrease in perceived flexion of the MCP joint compared with vibration alone (P < 0.05). For the elbow, vibration was applied over the distal tendon of triceps brachii and skin stretch over the dorsal forearm. When delivered alone, strong skin stretch evoked illusory elbow flexion in 5/10 subjects (9 +/- 4 degrees). Simultaneous strong skin stretch and vibration increased the illusory elbow flexion for the group by 1.5 times compared with vibration (P < 0.05). For the knee, vibration was applied over the patellar tendon and skin stretch over the thigh. Skin stretch alone evoked illusory knee flexion in 3/10 subjects (8 +/- 4 degrees) and when delivered during vibration, perceived knee flexion increased for the group by 1.4 times compared with vibration (P < 0.05). Hence inputs from cutaneous receptors, muscle receptors, and combined inputs from both receptors likely subserve kinesthesia at joints throughout the body.",

Simultaneous multichannel acquisition of surface EMG activity from flexor/extensor muscle groups of the upper and lower limbs was recorded. Investigated muscle group pairs included biceps/triceps brachii, wrist flexors/extensors, rectus/biceps femoris and tibialis anterioris/gastrocnemius. Time-frequency analysis of EMG activity at rest and while eliciting a stretch reflex was performed. The non-linear cross-correlation coefficient and time lag estimation were computed between paired channel groups both for baseline and post-intrathecal baclofen injection conditions for epochs consisting of 2 s prior to and 2 s after voluntary contraction. The effect of baclofen was assessed 3 h following single-bolus intrathecal injections of 25 or 50 microg during the baclofen trial and 6 months after baclofen pump implantation.In the baseline condition, the stretch reflex resulted in a synchronous increase in spectral EMG power in both the agonist and the antagonist muscles. The mean correlation coefficient between agonist and antagonist muscles was 0.948 (SD = 0.034), and the mean time lag was 4.64 ms (SD = 1.84 ms). After intrathecal administration of baclofen, a dramatic decrease in the correlation coefficient between agonist and antagonists (mean value = 0.342) during voluntary contraction was observed. This corresponded to a significant reduction of tone and spasticity in all four limbs, and reduction of the Ashworth score by 2 points on average.After intrathecal baclofen administration, we observed a significant decrease in the co-contraction pattern typically associated with upper motor neuron spasticity. This was evident clinically and was quantitatively expressed by the significantly decreased degree of coupling in EMG activity of agonist/antagonist muscles. Although a relatively small sample was investigated in this study, we were able to demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure in restoring selective activation of agonists during voluntary contraction.

Loads were applied either by the experimenter Without Anticipation or With Anticipation by the subject's own contralateral hand. Acceleration of the forearm movement (elbow extension and flexion) by loads and electromyograms (EMGs) of the biceps brachii (BB) and the triceps brachii (TB) muscle were recorded. Under With Anticipation conditions, preceding EMG activities of BB and TB muscles prior to the onset time of perturbation were clearly observed. Furthermore, the amount of these preceding EMG activities was larger in the heavy load perturbation than in the light load perturbation. Under Without Anticipation conditions, however, these preceding EMG activities were not observed. In the preceding EMG activities, EMG bursts (latency 20 msec.) of a presumed stretch reflex induced by the perturbation were clearly observed. Thus, the function of anticipatory adjustment of mainitaining the elbow angle definitely appears to optimize limb stability in the case of the mechanical self-applied perturbation. Furthermore, the extent of the anticipatory adjustment of the elbow angle was dependent on the predicted magnitude of load.",

Studies were performed on 99 subjects, aged 1 day to 31 years, of whom 53 were neonates. A longitudinal study was also performed on 29 subjects recruited at birth and studied 3 monthly until 12 months of age. Reciprocal inhibitory and excitatory reflexes were recorded in the surface EMG of contracting biceps brachii (Bi), evoked by taps applied to the tendon of triceps brachii (Tri). Reciprocal excitatory reflexes were recorded in all but one neonate. Reciprocal inhibition was observed in 25% of neonates; evidence is provided that it was likely to have been masked by low threshold reciprocal excitation in the remaining neonates. Reciprocal inhibition was demonstrated in all subjects after 9 months of age. In four neonates there was depression of inhibition of Bi during co-contraction of Bi and Tri implying that Group Ia interneurones may be under segmental and suprasegmental control at birth. Renshaw cells, identified in human postmortem cervical spinal cord by their morphology, location and calbindin D28K immunoreactivity, were present at 11 weeks post-conceptional age (PCA) and by 35 weeks PCA had mature morphological characteristics. In four neonates reciprocal inhibitory responses in Bi disappeared when the tap to Tri evoked its own homonymous phasic stretch reflex, providing neurophysiological evidence for Renshaw inhibition of Group Ia inhibitory interneurones.",

A 100-Hz vibration stimulating predominantly the muscle spindle afferent was transcutaneously applied to one muscle tendon of the triceps brachii, the wrist extensor and flexor muscles in 29 subjects with IFD (18 with torticollis, 9 with writer's cramp, 2 with blepharospasm) and 15 control subjects. The blindfolded subjects were instructed to copy any perceived movement with the opposite tracking arm. The elbow or wrist angle changes were quantified electronically. The TVR and subjects' perception of the TVR were evaluated by angle movements of the vibrated joint and of the tracking joint, respectively. Perception of the TVR was significantly reduced in dystonic subjects at both elbow and wrist joints, while magnitude of the TVR did not differ between the two groups.

Five hundred stimuli were given at each frequency. EMG was rectified and consecutive batches of 100 sweeps of each set of 500 responses were averaged time locked to the stimulus. All reflex components, E1, I1 and E2, exhibit habituation with the E1 component habituating the most and the I1 component the least. There was considerable variation in the rate of habituation between subjects. The rate of habituation was independent of the frequency of stimulation. Reflex responses were recorded from the triceps brachii muscle in eight subjects; this reflex response habituated at a faster rate than the E2 component recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. These results are discussed in relation to the choice of stimulus parameters for the clinical testing of cutaneous reflexes.

Since two years of age, he had noticed unstable gait. He showed evident scoliosis and enlarged great auricular nerves. Moderate to slight degrees of muscular atrophy and weakness of distal upper, and proximal and distal lower limbs were observed. Pes equinovarus deformity of both feet was obvious. Muscle stretch reflexes were absent in both limbs except decreased triceps brachii reflex. Vibratory sensation was decreased severely in the toes and mildly in the fingers. In cerebrospinal fluid, protein was mildly elevated. Median nerve motor conduction velocity was 5.0 m/sec. On sural nerve biopsy, both demyelinated and remyelinated axons and onion-bulbs without hypomyelination were observed. Therefore, the diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1 was made. The direct sequencing of the genomic DNA encoding the Po gene revealed a mutant allele, a guanine to thymine substitution of nucleotide position 436, which caused a substitution of phenylalanine for valine at amino acid position 146.

Therefore, it is the purpose of this research study to compare the lower extremity muscle and upper extremity muscle activation patterns associated with the curveball pitch and the fastball pitch from the stretch position. Twelve skilled (NCAA collegiate level) pitchers volunteered to be in this study, with a mean age of 22.3 ± 4.53 years, mean height of 1.74 ± 0.13 m, and mean mass of 89.0 k ± 10.97 kg. The pitchers were fitted with six surface electromyography (EMG) bipolar electrodes on the stride leg biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, ipsilateral side lower trapezius, upper trapezius, triceps brachii and biceps brachii. Each pitcher underwent maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) testing and then performed the fastball & curveball pitching sequence. All EMG variables of interest were normalized using MVIC data and compared between pitching type. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for all muscle activity as well. If significance was found a pairwise analysis (Bonferroni) was performed between pitch type, using SPSS (p 0.05). Significant differences in the mean muscle activity for the fastball and curveball pitched from the stretch were observed. A higher level of muscle activity was found for the stretch fastball when compared to the stretch curveball.

To this end, SSC(EFF) was analyzed in relation to DP velocity and performance. Eleven elite cross-country skiers performed an incremental test to determine maximal DP velocity (V(max)). Thereafter, cycle characteristics, elbow joint kinematics and poling forces were monitored on a treadmill while skiing at two sub-maximal and racing velocity (85% of V(max)). The average EMG activities of the triceps brachii and latissimus dorsi muscles were determined during the flexion and extension sub-phases of the poling cycle (EMG(FLEX), EMG(EXT)), as well as prior to pole plant (EMG(PRE)). SSC(EFF) was defined as the ratio of aEMG(FLEX) to aEMG(EXT). EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) increased with velocity for both muscles (P < 0.01), as did SSC(EFF) (from 0.9 ± 0.3 to 1.3 ± 0.5 for the triceps brachii and from 0.9 ± 0.4 to 1.5 ± 0.5 for the latissimus dorsi) and poling force (from 253 ± 33 to 290 ± 36N; P < 0.05). Furthermore, SSC(EFF) was positively correlated to Vmax, to EMG(PRE) and EMG(FLEX) (P < 0.05).

          "abstract": "1. This is a report of two series of experiments, one, observations on muscle spindles in the anesthetized cat, the other, based on the animal observations, concerned with limb-position sense in human subjects. 2. When the cat soleus muscle is contracted at a short length and then after a brief period is brought to an intermediate length, the integrated afferent activity recorded in dorsal roots is maintained at a high level. If the contraction is applied while the muscle is held at a long length, the subsequent level of afferent activity back at the intermediate length is much lower. A similar result is obtained if large amplitude vibration of the muscle is used instead of contraction. Recordings from single afferents confirm that these alterations in discharge could be attributed to the primary and secondary endings of muscle spindles. 3. Following the proposal that the resting discharge of muscle spindles contributes to the sense of limb position in man, we have used a sequence of contractions or periods of vibration of biceps and triceps brachii followed by an arm-matching task to look for errors in limb position consistent with the patterns of muscle afferent discharge observed in the animal experiments. 4. Blindfolded subjects were told to contract biceps of one, the test arm, with the arm flexed. After the arm had relaxed, it was placed by the experimenter at an intermediate angle that the subject was asked to match with the other, indicator arm. Then the subject was asked to contract triceps with the arm extended, and the matching task was repeated. 5. The hypothesis was that contracting a muscle while it was short raised the level of afferent discharge coming from it when the arm was moved to an intermediate position so that the muscle would be perceived as more stretched and the arm felt to be displaced further than it really was. Thus, when biceps was contracted with the arm flexed, this would lead the arm in the intermediate position to be perceived as more extended than it really was. When triceps was contracted with the arm extended, this would lead the arm in the intermediate position to be perceived as more flexed than it really was.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

          "abstract": "The effect of mechanoreflex on central blood pressure (BP) is unclear, although the influence of metaboreflex has been investigated. A relatively small contribution of the mechanoreflex to the pressor response to exercise has been considered in humans because many studies have failed to isolate the mechanoreflex-mediated pressor response. In a recent study, we successfully isolated a mechanoreflex-mediated pressor response using static passive stretching (SPS) in the forearm. Thus, it is possible to isolate the effect of the mechanoreflex on the central BP using this recently developed method. We investigated the effect of muscle mechanoreflex on central BP and compared the changes in the shape of the central BP waveform during mechanoreflex and metaboreflex.We measured 12 healthy males (age, 26 ± 2 years; height, 171.1 ± 5.2 cm; body mass, 63.3 ± 10.3 kg; body fat, 16.7% ± 3.9%; means ± standard deviation [SD]) in this study. All participants performed static passive stretching (SPS) of the forearm for 60 s to isolate the muscle mechanoreflex. They also performed 120 s of isometric handgrip (IHG) at 30% maximal voluntary contraction and underwent 180 s of post-exercise ischemia (PEI) to isolate the muscle metaboreflex. The carotid BP (cBP) waveform was obtained from the right common carotid artery as the central BP waveform. We evaluated the first systolic peak (P1) and second systolic peak (P2) from the cBP waveform.SPS increased cBP with an increase in P1 (p 0.05), whereas PEI increased it (p < 0.05). The relative change from rest (Δ) in P1 during SPS was positively correlated with that in stroke volume (r = 0.68; p < 0.05), and the ΔAP during PEI was positively correlated with that in total peripheral resistance TPR (r = 0.61; p < 0.05).These results suggest different effects of mechano- and metaboreflex on the change in shape of the central BP waveform; mechanoreflex and metaboreflex deform P1 and P2, respectively.Copyright © 2025 Nakamura, Heng and Hayashi.",

          "title": "Shortening Dome Osteotomy for the Correction of Coronal Plane Elbow Deformities.",
          "abstract": "Severe elbow deformities are common in developing countries because of neglect or as a result of prior treatment that achieved poor reduction. Various osteotomy techniques have been defined for the surgical correction of elbow deformities1-9. However, severe elbow deformities (>30°) pose a substantial challenge for surgeons because limited surgical options with high complication rates have been described in the literature. Shortening dome osteotomy is a useful method of correcting moderate-to-severe deformities and offers all of the advantages of previously described dome osteotomy without causing an undue stretching of neurovascular structures8,9.The anesthetized patient is placed in a lateral decubitus position under tourniquet control with the operative limb up, the elbow in 90° of flexion, and the forearm draped free to hang over a bolster kept between the chest and the forearm. A posterior midline approach is utilized, with the incision extending from 6 cm proximal to the tip of the olecranon to 2 cm distal. The ulnar nerve is identified and protected during the entire surgical procedure. In case of severe (>30°) and long-standing cubitus varus deformity, anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve is additionally performed to prevent nerve stretching after the deformity correction. A midline triceps-splitting approach is utilized along with subperiosteal dissection to expose the metaphyseodiaphyseal region of the distal humerus. Alternatively, the operating surgeon may choose to utilize a triceps-sparing approach. Hohmann retractors are placed at the medial and lateral aspects of distal humerus to protect the anterior neurovascular structures. Careful extraperiosteal dissection and a transverse incision over the anterior periosteum are performed to facilitate rotation of the distal fragment, as the anterior periosteum is usually thickened in cases of long-standing deformities. The posterior midline axis of the humerus is marked on the skin. The dome of the olecranon fossa is identified, and the distal osteotomy line is made just proximal and almost parallel to the dome. The proximal osteotomy line is made parallel and 5 to 8 mm proximal to the distal osteotomy line, as any further larger shortening may affect the muscle length-tension relationship. The posterior cortices of both domes and of the medial and lateral supracondylar ridges are osteotomized with use of an ultrasonic bone scalpel (Misonix), which was set at 70% amplitude control and 80% irrigation control. Alternatively, the osteotomy may be made by making multiple drill holes and connecting them with a 5-mm sharp osteotome or with use of a small-blade oscillating saw. The osteotomy of the anterior cortex is completed under direct vision with use of a Kerrison upcutting rongeur, after the subperiosteal separation of bone in order to protect the surrounding soft tissues. Kirschner wires are inserted in the distal fragment, and can be used like joysticks to manipulate the distal fragment to facilitate correction. Often, the anterior periosteum is found thickened and resists the free rotation of the distal fragment. In that case, a careful anterior extraperiosteal dissection is performed to protect the neurovascular structures, and this thickened periosteum may need to be incised transversely to facilitate deformity correction. Correction is achieved by rotating the distal fragment about the proximal fragment along the line of the parallel dome cuts, as per the preoperative planning, and correction may be verified intraoperatively using an image intensifier. Once the desired correction is obtained, the osteotomy site is provisionally fixed with Kirschner wires. Internal fixation is achieved with the help of a locking reconstruction or anatomically contoured posterolateral distal humerus locking plate plate applied over the posterolateral aspect of the distal humerus. Alternatively, the osteotomy site may be fixed with use of crossed-column screws. The osteotomy site may be grafted with small bone chips harvested from the excised curved bone fragment.Closing-wedge osteotomy is a simple technique for deformity correction. However, this procedure requires removal of a large wedge1 in cases of severe deformities, which leads to the generation of high displacing forces at the osteotomy site and at the prominence of the lateral condyle, as well as associated stretching of the ulnar nerve in cubitus varus correction. Other osteotomies like a step-cut osteotomy3, pentalateral osteotomy4, and 3D osteotomy5 are viable options for severe deformities; however, these techniques are difficult to reproduce because of their complex intraoperative templating, poor precision, and difficulty in maintaining fixation for higher degrees of deformity. Conventional dome osteotomy is a simple and reproducible method for the correction of severe deformities, but is associated with a large valgus moment and nerve stretching2. Shortening dome osteotomy offers all the advantages of conventional dome osteotomy, along with the added benefit of decreased tension in the neurovascular bundle8,9.Removal of a concentric curved piece of the bone enables the surgeon to correct even a severe deformity with greater ease and precision, without causing any undue stretching of the ulnar nerve. The surface area of the proximal dome (concave) is less than that of distal dome (convex) because of the natural distal humeral flare. The deformity correction involves additional medial translation of the distal fragment that prevents lateral condylar prominence.In a study of 18 patients with a mean age of 7.5 years (range, 5 years to 11 years), Singh et al.8 reported that the mean radiographic ulnohumeral angle improved from 26.1° varus (range, 22° to 34°) preoperatively to 7.3° valgus (range, 2° to 12°) postoperatively (p < 0.001). The mean lateral condylar prominence index was -2.4° (range, +4.7° to -10.5°) preoperatively compared with -1.7° (range, +4.5° to -5.1°) postoperatively (p = 0.595). Radiographic healing was observed in all of the patients at a mean of 7.1 weeks (range, 5 to 9 weeks). All patients regained their preoperative range of elbow motion within 6 months postoperatively.The dome of the olecranon fossa is identified, and the distal osteotomy line is made just proximal and parallel to the dome. The proximal osteotomy line is made parallel and 5 to 8 mm proximal to the distal osteotomy line.The posterior midline axis of the humerus is marked on the skin, as measuring displacement at this mark will help assess the magnitude of correction achieved.The posterior cortices of both of the domes are osteotomized with use of an ultrasonic bone scalpel. The osteotomy of the anterior cortex is completed under direct vision with use of a Kerrison upcutting rongeur, after the subperiosteal separation of bone in order to protect the surrounding soft tissues.Careful extraperiosteal dissection and a transverse incision over the anterior periosteum are performed to facilitate rotation of the distal fragment, as the anterior periosteum is usually thickened in cases of long-standing deformities.K-wire = Kirschner wire.Copyright © 2024 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.",

They are believed to encode muscle stretch and signal limb position and velocity. Here, we applied percutaneous pressure to a small area of extensor muscles at the forearm while recording spindle afferent responses, skeletal muscle activity, and hand kinematics. Three levels of sustained pressure were applied on the spindle-bearing muscle when the hand was relaxed and immobile (\"isometric\" condition) and when the participant's hand moved rhythmically at the wrist. As hypothesized to occur due to compression of the spindle capsule, we show that muscle pressure is an \"adequate\" stimulus for human spindles in isometric conditions and that pressure enhances spindle responses during stretch. Interestingly, release of sustained pressure in isometric conditions lowered spindle firing below baseline rates.

          "abstract": "Anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) syndrome is a rare condition characterized by isolated weakness in the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) muscle, sometimes accompanied by weakness in the index flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscle. In this clinical case report, an 18-year-old male presented with a right proximal both-bone forearm fracture that was sustained while playing soccer, with subsequent development of AIN palsy, without sensory deficits or progressive pain. Preoperative imaging was performed, showing a proximal third radius and mid-shaft ulna fracture. Given the progressive presentation of an acute AIN palsy, the patient was indicated for urgent operative intervention. During exploration and decompression of the AIN within the pronator tunnel, the nerve was found to be in continuity but was compressed by a large hematoma and the distal radial shaft. The patient recovered full median nerve function by his six-week postoperative examination and by his final follow-up recovered full range of motion with painless return to full activities. In proximal or mid-shaft both-bone forearm fractures, a careful neurovascular exam is essential, as uncommon conditions like anterior interosseous syndrome (AIS) can present without obvious sensory deficits or pain. Potential etiology for traumatic AIN compression includes significant fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, active extravasation on advanced imaging, and/or clinical concern for compressive hematoma. Patients presenting with FPL and/or index FDP weakness in the absence of sensory deficits or pain on passive stretch may benefit from dedicated surgical exploration and decompression of the AIN to prevent irreversible nerve damage.Copyright © 2024, Lavoie-Gagne et al.",

          "abstract": "The subject-specific range of motion (RoM) of a musculoskeletal joint system is balanced by pre-tension levels of individual muscles, which affects their contraction capability. Such an inherent pre-tension or pre-stretch of muscles is not measureable with in vivo experiments. Using a 3D continuum mechanical forward simulation approach for motion analysis of the musculoskeletal system of the forearm with 3 flexor and 2 extensor muscles, we developed an optimization process to determine the muscle fibre pre-stretches for an initial arm position, which is given human dataset. We used RoM values of a healthy person to balance the motion in extension and flexion. The performed sensitivity study shows that the fibre pre-stretches of the m. brachialis, m. biceps brachii and m. triceps brachii with 91 % dominate the objective flexion ratio, while m. brachiradialis and m. anconeus amount 7.8 % and 1.2 % . Within the multi-dimensional space of the surrogate model, 3D sub-spaces of primary variables, namely the dominant muscles and the global objective, flexion ratio, exhibit a path of optimal solutions. Within this optimal path, the muscle fibre pre-stretch of two flexors demonstrate a negative correlation, while, in contrast, the primary extensor, m. triceps brachii correlates positively to each of the flexors. Comparing the global optimum with four other designs along the optimal path, we saw large deviations, e.g., up to 15 ∘ in motion and up to 40% in muscle force.

          "abstract": "Since elbow injuries are common in adolescent baseball players, this study aimed to determine the relationship between musculoskeletal status and elbow injuries in 47 baseball players aged 12-14 years. Participants answered a questionnaire and had their general body measurements taken. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate muscle cross sectional areas (CSA) of the upper arm flexor and extensor muscles, and x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine the mass of the upper arm and the total mass of the forearm and hand. Shear wave elastography was used to determine muscle stiffness of the biceps brachii, brachialis, pronator teres, and brachioradialis. An orthopedic surgeon performed a clinical assessment and elbow ultrasonography for each participant to diagnose elbow injuries. The measured values were compared between the elbow injury and control groups using two-sample t-tests. The elbow injury group had significantly higher muscle stiffness in the brachialis (p < 0.001) and brachioradialis (p = 0.004) muscles and greater elbow flexor CSA of the distal upper arm (p = 0.004) than the control group. The total mass of the forearm and hand and the mass ratio of the forearm and hand to the upper arm were significantly greater in the elbow injury group than in the control group (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001). Thus, it may be necessary to increase flexibility of the brachialis and brachioradialis flexible by stretching and massaging in addition to evaluating the mass distal to the elbow and the elbow flexor muscle size of the distal upper arm to manage elbow injury in youth baseball players.

Fifteen healthy young males participated in the study. The shear elastic moduli of the BBL and BBS of the non-dominant arm were measured using SWE. The measurement positions were the resting position (shoulder flexion and abduction 0°) and four stretching positions.. The elbow was extended, and the forearm was pronated in all positions. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test to compare the shear elastic moduli between the resting and stretched limb positions. In addition, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used to compare shear elastic moduli between the stretching positions that were significantly different compared to the resting position.. Results show that for BBL and BBS, shear elastic moduli were significantly higher in the shoulder extension + external rotation and shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation positions than in the resting position. Moreover, the shear elastic modulus of the BBL was significantly higher in shoulder extension + external rotation than in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation. In contrast, the shear elastic modulus of the BBS was significantly higher in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation than in shoulder extension + external rotation.

          "abstract": "People whose jobs involve repetitive motions of the wrist and forearm can suffer from lateral epicondylitis, which is a significant burden on both the individual and the employer due to treatment costs, reduced productivity, and work absenteeism. This paper describes an ergonomic intervention to reduce lateral epicondylitis in the workstation of a textile logistics center. The intervention includes workplace-based exercise programs, evaluation of risk factors, and movement correction. An injury- and subject-specific score was calculated from the motion captured with wearable inertial sensors at the workplace to evaluate the risk factors of 93 workers. Then, a new working movement was adapted to the workplace, which limited the observed risk factors and took into account the subject-specific physical abilities. The movement was taught to the workers during personalized sessions. The risk factors of 27 workers were evaluated again after the intervention to validate the effectiveness of the movement correction. In addition, active warm-up and stretching programs were introduced as part of the workday to promote muscle endurance and improve resistance to repetitive stress. The present strategy offered good results at low cost, without any physical modification of the workplace and without any detriment to productivity.",

The organizational intervention intraoperative work break is a workplace strategy that has previously demonstrated positive effects in small-scale intervention studies.Twenty-one surgeons were exposed to three 90-min conditions: no breaks, 2.5-min passive (standing rest) or active (targeted stretching and mobilization exercises) breaks after 30-min work blocks. Muscular activity and fatigue of back, shoulder and forearm muscles were assessed by surface electromyography; upper body posture, i.e., spinal curvature, by inclination sensors; and heart rate and variability (HRV) by electrocardiography. Generalized estimating equations were used for statistical analyses. This study (NCT03715816) was conducted from March 2019 to October 2020.The HRV-metric SDNN tended to be higher, but not statistically significantly, in the intervention conditions compared to the control condition. No statistically significant effects of both interventions were detected for muscular activity, joint angles or heart rate.Intraoperative work breaks, whether passive or active, may counteract shoulder muscular fatigue and increase heart rate variability.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Robot-assisted neurorehabilitation is becoming an established method to complement conventional therapy after stroke and provide intensive therapy regimes in unsupervised settings (e.g., home rehabilitation). Intensive therapies may temporarily contribute to increasing muscle tone and spasticity, especially in stroke patients presenting tone alterations. If sustained without supervision, such an increase in muscle tone could have negative effects (e.g., functional disability, pain). We propose an online perturbation-based method that monitors finger muscle tone during unsupervised robot-assisted hand therapy exercises. Methods: We used the ReHandyBot, a novel 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) haptic device to perform robot-assisted therapy exercises training hand grasping (i.e., flexion-extension of the fingers) and forearm pronosupination. The tone estimation method consisted of fast (150 ms) and slow (250 ms) 20 mm ramp-and-hold perturbations on the grasping DOF, which were applied during the exercises to stretch the finger flexors. The perturbation-induced peak force at the finger pads was used to compute tone. In this work, we evaluated the method performance in a stiffness identification experiment with springs (0.97 and 1.57 N/mm), which simulated the stiffness of a human hand, and in a pilot study with subjects with increased muscle tone after stroke and unimpaired, which performed one active sensorimotor exercise embedding the tone monitoring method. Results: The method accurately estimates forces with root mean square percentage errors of 3.8% and 11.3% for the soft and stiff spring, respectively. In the pilot study, six chronic ischemic stroke patients [141.8 (56.7) months after stroke, 64.3 (9.5) years old, expressed as mean (std)] and ten unimpaired subjects [59.9 (6.1) years old] were tested without adverse events. The average reaction force at the level of the fingertip during slow and fast perturbations in the exercise were respectively 10.7 (5.6) N and 13.7 (5.6) N for the patients and 5.8 (4.2) N and 6.8 (5.1) N for the unimpaired subjects. Discussion: The proposed method estimates reaction forces of physical springs accurately, and captures online increased reaction forces in persons with stroke compared to unimpaired subjects within unsupervised human-robot interactions. In the future, the identified range of muscle tone increase after stroke could be used to customize therapy for each subject and maintain safety during intensive robot-assisted rehabilitation.Copyright © 2023 Ranzani, Chiriatti, Schwarz, Devittori, Gassert and Lambercy.",

          "abstract": "The muscle mechanoreflex has been considered to make a small contribution to the cardiovascular response to exercise in healthy humans because no pressor response has been observed during stimulation of mechanosensitive receptors, such as static passive stretching, during many human studies. There is room for rethinking this consideration since the pressor response to upper limb exercise is greater than that to lower limb exercise. We examined whether static passive stretching of the forearm muscles causes a muscle mechanoreflex-induced pressor response in humans. Eighteen healthy men were recruited for this study. After a 15-min rest period in the supine position with a neutral (0°) wrist joint angle, all participants completed static passive stretching of the forearm for 60 s at four different intensities: minimal painful passive stretching (PPS), moderate-intensity passive stretching (MPS), low-intensity passive stretching (LPS), and no load (NL). During the procedure, beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure was measured using finger photoplethysmography. The force generated between the passively stretched hand and the experimenter's hands was recorded using a force transducer. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) during PPS and MPS significantly increased from baseline during the last 40 s (P < 0.05). MAP was significantly greater at 50 s and 60 s, depending on the intensity. MPS induced a greater peak response in MAP than lower intensities (P < 0.05). None of the subjects reported pain during the MPS and LPS trials. Static passive stimulation of the forearm is an effective method of isolating the muscle mechanoareflex-induced pressor response in humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The muscle mechanoreflex was considered to have a small contribution to cardiovascular regulation during exercise in healthy humans. In contrast, the results of this study indicate that static stretching of the forearm induces a pressor response in healthy humans and suggest that the mechanoreflex explicitly induces the pressor response during exercise in humans.

          "abstract": "In this paper, a novel prototype of a cable-driven prosthetic hand with biorealisitic muscle property was developed. A pair of antagonistic muscles controlled the flexion and extension of the prosthetic index finger. Biorealistic properties of muscle were emulated using a neuromorphic model of muscle reflex in real time. The model output was coupled to a servo motor that tracked the computed muscle force. The servo motor was able to track model output within a frequency range from 0 to 8.29 (Hz) with a phase shift from 2 to 205 (deg). Surface electromyography signals collected from the amputee's forearm were used as α commands to drive the muscle model. With this prototype system, we evaluated its characteristics for force and stiffness control. Results of the force variability test showed that the standard deviation of fingertip force was linear to the mean fingertip force, indicating that force variability was proportional to the background force. At different levels of antagonistic co-contraction, the index finger and muscles displayed different levels of stiffness corresponding to the degree of co-activation. This prototype system showed the similar compliant behaviors of human limbs actuated with biological muscles. In further studies, this prototype system would be thoroughly evaluated for its biorealistic properties, and integrated with sensors to investigate feedback strategies of various sensory information for individuals with amputation. Clinical Relevance- This article established an antagonistic control of a cable-driven prosthetic hand with biorealistic properties of muscle reflex for application to individuals with amputation.",

Here, a novel KT based on auxetic structures is proposed to simplify the application procedure and allow personalization. This novel KT exploits the form-fitting property of auxetics as well as their ability to simultaneously expand in two perpendicular directions when stretched.

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND A floss band is used in resistance training and consists of a heavy-duty rubber resistance band to compress a joint or muscle group while performing a range of motion. Blood flow restriction (BFR) training combines low-intensity exercise with occlusion of blood flow, resulting in the effects of high-intensity training. This study aimed to identify the optimum forearm floss band intensity in 29 young adults while performing BFR training. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-nine young and healthy adults voluntarily participated in this experiment. One of 4 types of floss bands with different intensities was randomly selected from the subjects and wound around their forearms. The tension of the floss band was calculated to be the length of the participant's forearm when stretched by 105%, and then wound around the forearm. Blood flow was measured 4 times at regular intervals (pretest: 1 min, during: 2 min, posttest [1]: 1 min, posttest [2]: 2 min) using laser Doppler imaging. RESULTS We found that the application of floss bands resulted in a significant interaction between the intensity (colors) and time (pre/during/post) with regard to the hemodynamic changes (P<0.05). The hemodynamic evaluation revealed a reduction in the blood flow (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study shows that the use of blood flow restriction training requires support from guidelines for optimal floss band intensity, particularly with the increasing clinical use of this method.",

          "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia is rare. In some cases, the bleeding in muscle causes compartment syndrome. However, it is not clear whether fasciotomy should be performed for the compartment syndrome caused by acquired hemophilia because of the risk of bleeding and the unknown functional results.A 75-year-old woman was admitted with severe pain of the right forearm with no preceding traumatic event. The right forearm was obviously swollen, and stretch pain was observed. Subcutaneous hematomas were suspected in various parts of the body. Compartment pressure was 110 mmHg on the volar side. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was prolonged to 54.9 s. Fasciotomy was performed, and hematoma was observed in the volar compartment. Postoperative laboratory examinations revealed a low level of factor VIII (FVIII) activity (12.5%) and a high level of FVIII inhibitor (15.2 bethesda units/mL). Acquired hemophilia A was diagnosed. Though recombinant clotting factors were administered, transfusion of red blood cells reached 46 units (140 mL/unit). Hemostasis was achieved 9 d after fasciotomy. The total cost of the clotting factor concentrates administered reached 28834600 yen. With prednisolone, FVIII activity and aPTT recovered gradually. Final function of the hand was good in the index finger and excellent in the others.Fasciotomy resulted in good function of the hand in a case of non-traumatic compartment syndrome caused by acquired hemophilia, but life-threatening bleeding occurred, and the cost of clotting factor treatment was high. Preparation of sufficient blood transfusion, preoperative administration of recombinant activated clotting factor VII, and prompt fasciotomy could be ideal for such cases.©The Author(s) 2021.

          "abstract": "When the biceps tendon is tapped, a contraction is elicited in the biceps muscle. This also occurs with tapping of the radial bone, and it has been suggested that vibration is a stimulus for deep tendon reflexes. We investigated whether the normal stimulus for the deep tendon reflex is a sudden stretch, a phasic vibration, or both. Furthermore, we investigated the importance of forearm position for the reflex response in controls and stroke patients.We investigated 50 neurological outpatients without clinical signs of neurological disorders in the arms. The biceps tendon and distal radius were tapped with the forearm in the midway (90°), supinated, and pronated positions. In 10 of these patients, the two reflexes were also investigated with quantitative electromyography (EMG) measurements in the 3 positions. Another 10 patients were investigated clinically when stretch of elbow was eliminated and 17 patients were examined when prestretching of the biceps tendon was avoided. Finally, we examined 32 patients that had experienced stroke.In 94% (47/50) of patients, after a radial tap, the biceps contraction disappeared in the supinated forearm, and the median peak-to-peak amplitude of the surface EMG response (n = 10) decreased from 1.1 to 0.2 mV (p < .01). Elimination of elbow stretch as well as pressure on the biceps tendon did not change the reflex response. In 84% (27/32) of stroke patients, after a radial tap, the biceps contraction persisted in supination in the arm with hyperreflexia.The combined clinical and EMG results are consistent with the concept that the deep tendon reflexes in man can be elicited by both stretch and phasic vibration.

          "abstract": "The central nervous system uses feedback processes that occur at multiple time scales to control interactions with the environment. The long-latency response (LLR) is the fastest process that directly involves cortical areas, with a motoneuron response measurable 50 ms following an imposed limb displacement. Several behavioral factors concerning perturbation mechanics and the active role of muscles prior or during the perturbation can modulate the long-latency response amplitude (LLRa) in the upper limbs, but the interactions among many of these factors had not been systematically studied before. We conducted a behavioral study on thirteen healthy individuals to determine the effect and interaction of four behavioral factors - background muscle torque, perturbation direction, perturbation velocity, and task instruction - on the LLRa evoked from the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles after velocity-controlled wrist displacements. The effects of the four factors were quantified using both a 0D statistical analysis on the average perturbation-evoked EMG signal in the period corresponding to an LLR, and using a timeseries analysis of EMG signals. All factors significantly modulated LLRa, and their combination nonlinearly contributed to modulating the LLRa. Specifically, all the three-way interaction terms that could be computed without including the interaction between instruction and velocity significantly modulated the LLR. Analysis of the three-way interaction terms of the 0D model indicated that for the ECU muscle, the LLRa evoked when subjects are asked to maintain their muscle activation in response to the perturbations was greater than the one observed when subjects yielded to the perturbations (p < 0.001), but this effect was not measured for muscles undergoing shortening or in absence of background muscle activation. Moreover, higher perturbation velocity increased the LLRa evoked from the stretched muscle in presence of a background torque (p < 0.001), but no effects of velocity were measured in absence of background torque. Also, our analysis identified significant modulations of LLRa in muscles shortened by the perturbation, including an interaction between torque and velocity, and an effect of both torque and velocity. The time-series analysis indicated the significance of additional transient effects in the LLR region for muscles undergoing shortening.Copyright © 2021 Weinman, Arfa-Fatollahkhani, Zonnino, Nikonowicz and Sergi.",

          "abstract": "We used the idea of synergic control and the framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis to explore the synergic control of a single muscle. Individual motor units in flexor digitorum superficialis formed two-three groups (MU-modes) with parallel changes in firing frequency, robust over force-up and force-down segments. There were strong force-stabilizing synergies in the MU-mode space during accurate cyclical force production. The results show, for the first time, that the idea of synergic control is applicable to individual muscles. The results suggest that segmental spinal mechanisms, such as recurrent inhibition and stretch reflex, probably play a major role in the synergic control of action.In the present study, for the first time, we have used the idea of synergic control and the framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis to test two hypotheses: (i) individual motor units are organized into stable groups (MU-modes) with parallel scaling of firing rates with changes in the muscle force, and (ii) the gains of MU-mode involvement co-vary to stabilize the desired force magnitude. Young healthy subjects performed accurate cyclical force tracing tasks at 1 Hz by pressing with intermediate phalanges; only one finger was instructed to produce force at a time. Surface electromyographic signal from flexor digitorum superficialis was recorded and used to identify individual motor units and their firing frequencies. Principal component analysis with rotation and factor extraction was used to identify MU-modes, which showed similar compositions over the force-up and force-down task segments. Inter-cycle variance analysis in the MU-mode space confirmed the existence of strong synergies stabilizing finger force. There were no synergies stabilizing MU-mode magnitude in the space of individual motor units. This is the first application of the UCM framework to the neural control of a single muscle. It extends the applicability of this approach to analysis of individual muscles. We discuss the importance of the findings for the idea of hierarchical control and the notion of muscle compartments.

          "abstract": "In an uncertain external environment, the motor system may need to respond rapidly to an unexpected stimulus. Limb displacement causes muscle stretch; the corrective response has multiple activity bursts, which are suggested to originate from different parts of the neuraxis. The earliest response is so fast, it can only be produced by spinal circuits; this is followed by slower components thought to arise from primary motor cortex (M1) and other supraspinal areas. Spinal cord (SC) contributions to the slower components are rarely considered. To address this, we recorded neural activity in M1 and the cervical SC during a visuomotor tracking task, in which 2 female macaque monkeys moved their index finger against a resisting motor to track an on-screen target. Following the behavioral trial, an increase in motor torque rapidly returned the finger to its starting position (lever velocity >200°/s). Many cells responded to this passive mechanical perturbation (M1: 148 of 211 cells, 70%; SC: 67 of 119 cells, 56%). The neural onset latency was faster for SC compared with M1 cells (21.7 ± 11.2 ms vs 25.5 ± 10.7 ms, respectively, mean ± SD). Using spike-triggered averaging, some cells in both regions were identified as likely premotor cells, with monosynaptic connections to motoneurons. Response latencies for these cells were compatible with a contribution to the muscle responses following the perturbation. Comparable fractions of responding neurons in both areas were active up to 100 ms after the perturbation, suggesting that both SC circuits and supraspinal centers could contribute to later response components.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Following a limb perturbation, multiple reflexes help to restore limb position. Given conduction delays, the earliest part of these reflexes can only arise from spinal circuits. By contrast, long-latency reflex components are typically assumed to originate from supraspinal centers. We recorded from both spinal and motor cortical cells in monkeys responding to index finger perturbations. Many spinal interneurons, including those identified as projecting to motoneurons, responded to the perturbation; the timing of responses was compatible with a contribution to both short- and long-latency reflexes. We conclude that spinal circuits also contribute to long-latency reflexes in distal and forearm muscles, alongside supraspinal regions, such as the motor cortex and brainstem.Copyright © 2020 Soteropoulos and Baker.",

          "abstract": "Acute exertional compartment syndrome (AECS) involving the upper extremity is a rare form of compartment syndrome that occurs after physical activity. Despite its infrequent occurrence, AECS has devastating sequelae, including muscle necrosis and nerve injury. It is imperative to promptly evaluate for AECS in any patient who has notable pain and sensory changes in the context of recent physical activity because of the dire consequences of a missed diagnosis. A 34-year-old man presented to the emergency department with excruciating pain and diffuse paresthesias in his bilateral arms and forearms after participating in a push-up contest. He also had pain with passive stretch of his triceps. Because of these physical examination findings and uncontrollable pain, a clinical diagnosis of AECS was made and was managed with fasciotomies. Postoperatively, the patient's pain and paresthesias slowly resolved, and he was eventually able to return to work at full capacity as a construction worker. This example of AECS of bilateral upper extremities emphasizes that it is a condition that, although rare, is real and must be taken seriously. With appropriate clinical suspicion, a prompt diagnosis can be made, and potentially devastating consequences can be avoided.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

          "abstract": "Early fasciotomy is the standard of care for upper extremity compartment syndrome (UECS) and may prevent the development of irreversible contractures of forearm and hand musculature, a pathology initially described by Volkmann (VOLKMAN Centralblat fur hirurgie 8:801–803, 1881). Compartment syndrome (CS) is a feared orthopedic complication and common cause for permanent functional damage and limb loss as well as one of the most common causes for litigation in orthopedic surgery (DePasse et al. J Am Acad Orthop Surg 25:e109–e113, 2017; Marchesi et al. Injury 45(Suppl 6):S16–S20, 2014). CS of the forearm is the second most common cause of CS in the extremities given the injury proneness of the upper extremity and hand as a prime organ of prehension and grasp (Leversedge et al. J Hand Surg Am 36:544–559, 2011). Given this important physiologic function, one can argue that the functional loss due to an established CS is higher than that of the lower extremity. For UECS, a high level of alertness to clinical symptoms such as pain to passive stretch and increasing pain or analgesic requirements is key to not miss the diagnosis in the alert patient. UECS shares common etiologies for CS seen in other body areas: either an external reduction of CS size such as external pressure from casts, dressings, and gravity or increase in compartmental size as seen in bleeding and fracture displacement, microvascular barrier damage in ischemia, burn injury, and envenomations (Leversedge et al. J Hand Surg Am 36:544–559, 2011). Several additional etiologies are pertinent to UECS such as iatrogenic extravasations of intravenous fluids, upper extremity arterial catheterizations (Omori et al. Orthopedics 36:e121–e125, 2013), and electrical trauma (Lee et al. J Am Acad Orthop Surg, 2018). UECS is most commonly encountered in the forearm, which has three designated compartments (i.e., the lateral (mobile wad), the dorsal extensor, and the volar) of which contains the bulk of muscle mass in the flexor compartment. There are ten designated hand compartments which can be affected in hand compartment syndrome as seen, for instance, in crushing injuries (exploded hand syndrome), fractures and dislocations, as well as extravasations. When performing fasciotomies for UECS, special emphasis must be placed to decompress the muscles of the deep flexor compartment due to their nonredundant blood supply which makes them especially prone to ischemic damage (Inoue and Taylor Plast Reconstr Surg 98:195–210, 1996).Copyright 2019, The Author(s).",

          "abstract": "This study aims to quantify passive muscle stiffness of spastic wrist flexors in stroke survivors using shear wave elastography (SWE) and to correlate with neural and non-neural contributors estimated from a biomechanical model to hyper-resistance measured during passive wrist extension. Fifteen hemiplegic individuals after stroke with Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score larger than one were recruited. SWE were used to measure Young's modulus of flexor carpi radialis muscle with joint from 0° (at rest) to 50° flexion (passive stretch condition), with 10° interval. The neural (NC) and non-neural components i.e., elasticity component (EC) and viscosity component (VC) of the wrist joint were analyzed from a motorized mechanical device NeuroFlexor® (NF). Combining with a validated biomechanical model, the neural reflex and muscle stiffness contribution to the increased resistance can be estimated. MAS and Fugl-Meyer upper limb score were also measured to evaluate the spasticity and motor function of paretic upper limb. Young's modulus was significantly higher in the paretic side of flexor carpi radialis than that of the non-paretic side (p < 0.001) and it increased significantly from 0° to 50° of the paretic side (p < 0.001). NC, EC, and VC on the paretic side were higher than the non-paretic side (p < 0.05). There was moderate significant positive correlation between the Young's Modulus and EC (r = 0.565, p = 0.028) and VC (r = 0.645, p = 0.009) of the paretic forearm flexor muscle. Fugl-Meyer of the paretic forearm flexor has a moderate significant negative correlation with NC (r = -0.578, p = 0.024). No significant correlation between MAS and shear elastic modulus or NF components was observed. This study demonstrated the feasibility of combining SWE and NF as a non-invasive approach to assess spasticity of paretic muscle and joint in stroke clinics. The neural and non-neural components analysis as well as correlation findings of muscle stiffness of SWE might provide understanding of mechanism behind the neuromuscular alterations in stroke survivors and facilitate the design of suitable intervention for them.",

          "abstract": "What is the central question of this study? Corticospinal excitability to biceps brachii is known to modulate according to upper-limb posture. Here, cervicomedullary stimulation was used to investigate potential spinal contributions to elbow angle-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability at rest. What is the main finding and its importance? At more extended elbow angles, biceps responses to cervicomedullary stimulation were decreased, whereas cortically evoked responses (normalized to cervicomedullary-evoked responses) were increased. Results suggest decreased spinal excitability but increased cortical excitability as the elbow is placed in a more extended position, an effect that is unlikely to be attributable to cutaneous stretch receptor activation.Corticospinal excitability to biceps brachii is known to modulate according to upper-limb posture. In study 1, our aim was to investigate potential spinal contributions to this modulation and the independent effect of elbow angle. Biceps responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (motor evoked potentials; MEPs) and electrical cervicomedullary stimulation (cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials; CMEPs) were measured at five elbow angles ranging from full extension to 130 deg of flexion. In study 2, possible contributions of cutaneous stretch receptors to elbow angle-dependent excitability changes were investigated by eliciting MEPs and CMEPs in three conditions of skin stretch about the elbow (stretch to mimic full extension, no stretch or stretch to mimic flexion). Each study had 12 participants. Evoked potentials were acquired at rest, with participants seated, the shoulder flexed 90 deg and forearm supinated. The MEPs and CMEPs were normalized to maximal compound muscle action potentials. In study 1, as the elbow was moved to more extended positions, there were no changes in MEPs (P = 0.963), progressive decreases in CMEPs (P < 0.0001; CMEPs at 130 deg flexion ∼220% of full extension) and increases in the MEP/CMEP ratio (P = 0.019; MEP/CMEP at 130 deg flexion ∼20% of full extension). In study 2, there were no changes in MEPs (P = 0.830) or CMEPs (P = 0.209) between skin stretch conditions. Therefore, although results suggest a decrease in spinal and an increase in supraspinal excitability at more extended angles, the mechanism for these changes in corticospinal excitability to biceps is not cutaneous stretch receptor feedback.© 2019 The Authors.

Cysticercosis involving the lateral pterygoids may cause limitation of mouth opening and may mimic clinical symptoms of a temporomandibular disorder. A 37-year-old female presented with 1-month-old complaint of limited mandibular range of motion. She reported a similar episode a year earlier and was diagnosed with a temporomandibular joint disorder by her primary dentist. Comprehensive intra- and extra-oral examinations were performed, which revealed a limitation of mouth opening accompanied by mild limitation of contralateral excursion. A magnetic resonance imaging revealed a ring-enhancing lesion within the left pterygoid muscle suggestive of cysticercosis. The patient was referred to her primary care physician for further treatment and given physical therapy (stretching exercises) to improve mouth opening. One week later, she developed lesions in the arm and trunk. Further ultrasound imaging of the abdomen and the forearms confirmed the diagnosis of cysticercosis. She was treated with albendazole, physiotherapy, joint stabilization appliance, and had eventual complete recovery. This case emphasizes the importance of diagnosis of a systemic condition that may have serious implications, if untreated, and the importance of a comprehensive evaluation, workup, and multidisciplinary management.",

          "abstract": "In individuals with hemiparetic stroke, reaching with the paretic arm can be impaired by abnormal muscle coactivation. Prior trails for improving upper extremity functions after stroke have underestimated the role of gravitational force in motor planning and execution.The aims this trial were to study the effect of gravity as a facilitator for elbow extension and to estimate the immediate and retention effects of task specific training of elbow extensors on upper extremity function after stroke.Twenty-six right handed patients with first ever stroke represented the sample of the study. The participants were randomly assigned into two equal groups. The study group received treatment through two phases. Phase one included training for the elbow extensors in an antigravity position. Phase two included a set of task specific exercise for 16 weeks. The control group received traditional passive stretch and range of motion exercises. Manual dexterity and upper limb function were assessed by Nine-Hole Peg Test and Fugl-Meyer upper extremity. Goniometry was used for measuring elbow extension and forearm supination active ranges of motion.Significant improvements were observed in Nine-Hole Peg Test, Fugl-Meyer upper extremity, and ranges of motion at postintervention and follow-up compared to preintervention at P≤0.05.The results of this study provide an evidence that antigravity positions can be used as a centrally presented facilitator of elbow extension. Additionally, task specific training was effective in improving upper extremity function and elbow extension range of motion.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of pain sensitization on the prognosis of lateral epicondylitis (LE) treated by self-stretching exercises and the use of a counterforce brace.We enrolled 131 patients who presented with isolated LE symptoms for less than 6 months. We initially measured pain sensitization by assessing patients' pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) in the contralateral middorsal forearm and administering a pain sensitization questionnaire (PSQ). For outcome assessments, we assessed the self-administered, patient-reported Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire at 6 and 12 months' follow-up.Initial PSQ scores correlated moderately with baseline DASH scores and slightly with symptom duration; PPTs correlated slightly with baseline DASH scores. After we accounted for confounding variables, patient-reported disability was associated with lower PPTs, higher PSQ scores, and manual labor at 6 months. These 3 factors accounted for 36% of variance in the DASH scores; however, at 12 months only the PSQ score was associated with higher DASH scores, accounting for 14% of variance.Pain sensitization during the early stages of LE correlated with initial symptom severity and duration and was associated with persistently increasing disability after 1 year of nonsurgical treatment. More research is needed to show whether early identification and treatment of pain sensitization will enhance LE treatment outcomes.Prognostic IV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

          "abstract": "To confirm the existence of epimuscular myofascial force transmission in humans, this study examined if manipulating joint angle to stretch the muscle can alter the shear modulus of a resting adjacent muscle, and whether there are regional differences in this response. The biceps brachii (BB: manipulated muscle) and the brachialis (BRA: resting adjacent muscle) were deemed suitable for this study because they are neighboring, yet have independent tendons that insert onto different bones. In order to manipulate the muscle length of BB only, the forearm was passively set at supination, neutral, and pronation positions. For thirteen healthy young adult men, the shear modulus of BB and BRA was measured with shear-wave elastography at proximal and distal muscle regions for each forearm position and with the elbow joint angle at either 100° or 160°. At both muscle regions and both elbow positions, BB shear modulus increased as the forearm was rotated from a supinated to pronated position. Conversely, BRA shear modulus decreased as function of forearm position. The effect of forearm position on shear modulus was most pronounced in the distal muscle region when the elbow was at 160°. The observed alteration of shear modulus of the resting adjacent muscle indicates that epimuscular myofascial force transmission is present in the human upper limb. Consistent with this assertion, we found that the effect of muscle length on shear modulus in both muscles was region-dependent. Our results also suggest that epimuscular myofascial force transmission may be facilitated at stretched muscle lengths.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "title": "The pathology of torture.",
          "abstract": "Detainees may be subjected to torture and extra-judicial execution by State actors and terrorists. But, the pathology of torture has not been well-described. This is due to the lack of autopsies performed on victims of torture, mostly due to the disposal of the bodies of the victims by their torturers. On this basis, the cause of death of detainees subjected to torture is often a matter of speculation or remains obscure. This paper provides an overview of the pathology of torture based on the authour's experience with the autopsies of torture victims. At autopsy, many different types of inflicted injuries may be observed, often ranging in severity. However, three recurrent patterns of trauma that are the hallmarks of torture were recognized by the authour: (1) blunt impact trauma characterized by bruises, patterned injuries, and internal injuries; (2) electrical and thermal injuries; and (3) injuries from stress positions that occur from prolonged suspension. The most under-recognized form of fatal torture are the complications of stress positions related to suspension of the victim's body by the upper, or lower extremities. For example, prolonged suspension by reverse hanging (suspension of the victim's body by the wrists or forearms with the arms extended backward at the shoulder joint) can cause over-stretching and necrosis of the muscles of the shoulder, resulting in fatal myoglobinuric renal failure. It is essential that autopsies be performed on all detainees who die in custody, to determine if torture played a role in death. Furthermore, the true nature of the injuries sustained often remains obscure unless a musculocutaneous dissection is performed. Specifically, dissection of the back, limbs and the soles of the feet, as well as the shoulders and knees is essential to determine if specific forms of torture have been applied. This is especially true for fatal complications of stress positions. Seeking the truth about the medical consequences of fatal torture will raise awareness about torture-related injuries, assist in rehabilitation of torture survivors, and strengthen forensic humanitarian action.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

Generally, the pathology is limited to the gray matter of the anterior horns in the lower cervical spinal cord. However, in rare cases the damage can spread to the white matter and present as long tract signs.We report on a 30-year-old female whose onset presented as unilateral muscle atrophy of the right hand in her teens. Despite conservative treatment using a cervical collar, she developed prolonged bilateral muscle atrophy, sensory disturbance and spastic gait, along with bladder and rectal disturbances. Her hands were frozen into a 'claw-like' gesture and her intrinsic muscles were highly atrophic. She was unable to unclench her hands. Although the space available for the spinal cord was large, the spinal cord was highly atrophic. She had local kyphosis with a large (61°) flexion range of motion. During flexion the spinal cord was stretched, resulting in contact with the posterior wall of the vertebrae. Posterior fusion surgery was performed to prevent progression of the myelopathy. After surgery, she gained mild improvement in both muscle strength and her hand's movement. However, her spastic gait and muscle atrophy remained.Most cases of cervical flexion myelopathy as represented by Hirayama disease have a self-limiting benign prognosis. However, some cases can develop advanced myelopathy with long tract signs. Long-term follow-up is recommended for these cases because they may require early surgical treatment.",

          "abstract": "GDAP1-related hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (GDAP1-HMSN) is a peripheral neuropathy (also known as a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) that typically affects the lower extremities earlier and more severely than the upper extremities. As the neuropathy progresses, the distal upper extremities also become severely affected. Proximal muscles can also become weak. Age at onset ranges from infancy to early childhood. In most cases, disease progression causes disabilities within the first or second decade of life. At the end of the second decade, most individuals are wheelchair bound. Disease progression varies considerably even within the same family. The neuropathy can be either of the demyelinating type with reduced nerve conduction velocities or the axonal type with normal nerve conduction velocities. Vocal cord paresis is common. Intelligence is normal. Life expectancy is usually normal, but on occasion may be reduced because of secondary complications.Diagnosis of GDAP1-HMSN is based on clinical findings and confirmed by detection on molecular genetic testing of either biallelic pathogenic variants in GDAP1 in those with autosomal recessive inheritance or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in those with autosomal dominant inheritance.Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Treatment may include: daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles tendon shortening, ankle/foot orthoses, orthopedic surgery, forearm crutches or canes, wheelchairs, treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and career and employment counseling. Surveillance: Regular evaluation by the multidisciplinary team to determine neurologic status and functional disability. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs and medications known to cause nerve damage; obesity.GDAP1-HMSN is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) manner; autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance is also observed. AR inheritance: At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible once the pathogenic variants in an affected family member have been identified. AD inheritance: Offspring of an individual with AD GDAP1-HMSN have a 50% risk of inheriting the GDAP1 pathogenic variant from their affected parent. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for GDAP1-HMSN and preimplantation genetic testing are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified.Copyright © 1993-2025, University of Washington, Seattle.

The study purpose was to determine the efficacy of resistance training and ibuprofen supplementation on bone and muscle properties in postmenopausal women.Participants (n = 90, 65.3 ± 4.9 yr) were randomly assigned to: supervised resistance training or stretching (placebo-exercise) with postexercise ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo supplementation for 3 d·wk (9 months). Baseline and postintervention measurements included distal and shaft scans of the forearm and lower leg using peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Distal site outcomes included cross-sectional area, content, and density for total and trabecular bone, as well as estimated bone strength in compression.

Here, we applied percutaneous pressure to a small area of extensor muscles at the forearm while recording spindle afferent responses, skeletal muscle activity, and hand kinematics. Three levels of sustained pressure were applied on the spindle-bearing muscle when the hand was relaxed and immobile (\"isometric\" condition) and when the participant's hand moved rhythmically at the wrist. As hypothesized to occur due to compression of the spindle capsule, we show that muscle pressure is an \"adequate\" stimulus for human spindles in isometric conditions and that pressure enhances spindle responses during stretch.

          "abstract": "Anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) syndrome is a rare condition characterized by isolated weakness in the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) muscle, sometimes accompanied by weakness in the index flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscle. In this clinical case report, an 18-year-old male presented with a right proximal both-bone forearm fracture that was sustained while playing soccer, with subsequent development of AIN palsy, without sensory deficits or progressive pain. Preoperative imaging was performed, showing a proximal third radius and mid-shaft ulna fracture. Given the progressive presentation of an acute AIN palsy, the patient was indicated for urgent operative intervention. During exploration and decompression of the AIN within the pronator tunnel, the nerve was found to be in continuity but was compressed by a large hematoma and the distal radial shaft. The patient recovered full median nerve function by his six-week postoperative examination and by his final follow-up recovered full range of motion with painless return to full activities. In proximal or mid-shaft both-bone forearm fractures, a careful neurovascular exam is essential, as uncommon conditions like anterior interosseous syndrome (AIS) can present without obvious sensory deficits or pain. Potential etiology for traumatic AIN compression includes significant fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, active extravasation on advanced imaging, and/or clinical concern for compressive hematoma. Patients presenting with FPL and/or index FDP weakness in the absence of sensory deficits or pain on passive stretch may benefit from dedicated surgical exploration and decompression of the AIN to prevent irreversible nerve damage.Copyright © 2024, Lavoie-Gagne et al.",

We examined whether static passive stretching of the forearm muscles causes a muscle mechanoreflex-induced pressor response in humans. Eighteen healthy men were recruited for this study. After a 15-min rest period in the supine position with a neutral (0°) wrist joint angle, all participants completed static passive stretching of the forearm for 60 s at four different intensities: minimal painful passive stretching (PPS), moderate-intensity passive stretching (MPS), low-intensity passive stretching (LPS), and no load (NL). During the procedure, beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure was measured using finger photoplethysmography. The force generated between the passively stretched hand and the experimenter's hands was recorded using a force transducer. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) during PPS and MPS significantly increased from baseline during the last 40 s (P < 0.05). MAP was significantly greater at 50 s and 60 s, depending on the intensity.

          "abstract": "The central nervous system uses feedback processes that occur at multiple time scales to control interactions with the environment. The long-latency response (LLR) is the fastest process that directly involves cortical areas, with a motoneuron response measurable 50 ms following an imposed limb displacement. Several behavioral factors concerning perturbation mechanics and the active role of muscles prior or during the perturbation can modulate the long-latency response amplitude (LLRa) in the upper limbs, but the interactions among many of these factors had not been systematically studied before. We conducted a behavioral study on thirteen healthy individuals to determine the effect and interaction of four behavioral factors - background muscle torque, perturbation direction, perturbation velocity, and task instruction - on the LLRa evoked from the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles after velocity-controlled wrist displacements. The effects of the four factors were quantified using both a 0D statistical analysis on the average perturbation-evoked EMG signal in the period corresponding to an LLR, and using a timeseries analysis of EMG signals. All factors significantly modulated LLRa, and their combination nonlinearly contributed to modulating the LLRa. Specifically, all the three-way interaction terms that could be computed without including the interaction between instruction and velocity significantly modulated the LLR. Analysis of the three-way interaction terms of the 0D model indicated that for the ECU muscle, the LLRa evoked when subjects are asked to maintain their muscle activation in response to the perturbations was greater than the one observed when subjects yielded to the perturbations (p < 0.001), but this effect was not measured for muscles undergoing shortening or in absence of background muscle activation. Moreover, higher perturbation velocity increased the LLRa evoked from the stretched muscle in presence of a background torque (p < 0.001), but no effects of velocity were measured in absence of background torque. Also, our analysis identified significant modulations of LLRa in muscles shortened by the perturbation, including an interaction between torque and velocity, and an effect of both torque and velocity. The time-series analysis indicated the significance of additional transient effects in the LLR region for muscles undergoing shortening.Copyright © 2021 Weinman, Arfa-Fatollahkhani, Zonnino, Nikonowicz and Sergi.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to quantify passive muscle stiffness of spastic wrist flexors in stroke survivors using shear wave elastography (SWE) and to correlate with neural and non-neural contributors estimated from a biomechanical model to hyper-resistance measured during passive wrist extension. Fifteen hemiplegic individuals after stroke with Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score larger than one were recruited. SWE were used to measure Young's modulus of flexor carpi radialis muscle with joint from 0° (at rest) to 50° flexion (passive stretch condition), with 10° interval. The neural (NC) and non-neural components i.e., elasticity component (EC) and viscosity component (VC) of the wrist joint were analyzed from a motorized mechanical device NeuroFlexor® (NF). Combining with a validated biomechanical model, the neural reflex and muscle stiffness contribution to the increased resistance can be estimated. MAS and Fugl-Meyer upper limb score were also measured to evaluate the spasticity and motor function of paretic upper limb. Young's modulus was significantly higher in the paretic side of flexor carpi radialis than that of the non-paretic side (p < 0.001) and it increased significantly from 0° to 50° of the paretic side (p < 0.001). NC, EC, and VC on the paretic side were higher than the non-paretic side (p < 0.05). There was moderate significant positive correlation between the Young's Modulus and EC (r = 0.565, p = 0.028) and VC (r = 0.645, p = 0.009) of the paretic forearm flexor muscle. Fugl-Meyer of the paretic forearm flexor has a moderate significant negative correlation with NC (r = -0.578, p = 0.024). No significant correlation between MAS and shear elastic modulus or NF components was observed. This study demonstrated the feasibility of combining SWE and NF as a non-invasive approach to assess spasticity of paretic muscle and joint in stroke clinics. The neural and non-neural components analysis as well as correlation findings of muscle stiffness of SWE might provide understanding of mechanism behind the neuromuscular alterations in stroke survivors and facilitate the design of suitable intervention for them.",

          "abstract": "Detainees may be subjected to torture and extra-judicial execution by State actors and terrorists. But, the pathology of torture has not been well-described. This is due to the lack of autopsies performed on victims of torture, mostly due to the disposal of the bodies of the victims by their torturers. On this basis, the cause of death of detainees subjected to torture is often a matter of speculation or remains obscure. This paper provides an overview of the pathology of torture based on the authour's experience with the autopsies of torture victims. At autopsy, many different types of inflicted injuries may be observed, often ranging in severity. However, three recurrent patterns of trauma that are the hallmarks of torture were recognized by the authour: (1) blunt impact trauma characterized by bruises, patterned injuries, and internal injuries; (2) electrical and thermal injuries; and (3) injuries from stress positions that occur from prolonged suspension. The most under-recognized form of fatal torture are the complications of stress positions related to suspension of the victim's body by the upper, or lower extremities. For example, prolonged suspension by reverse hanging (suspension of the victim's body by the wrists or forearms with the arms extended backward at the shoulder joint) can cause over-stretching and necrosis of the muscles of the shoulder, resulting in fatal myoglobinuric renal failure. It is essential that autopsies be performed on all detainees who die in custody, to determine if torture played a role in death. Furthermore, the true nature of the injuries sustained often remains obscure unless a musculocutaneous dissection is performed. Specifically, dissection of the back, limbs and the soles of the feet, as well as the shoulders and knees is essential to determine if specific forms of torture have been applied. This is especially true for fatal complications of stress positions. Seeking the truth about the medical consequences of fatal torture will raise awareness about torture-related injuries, assist in rehabilitation of torture survivors, and strengthen forensic humanitarian action.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

          "abstract": "Essential tremor is an involuntary trembling of body limbs in people without tremor-related disease. In previous study, suppression of tremor by sensory electrical stimulation was confirmed on the index finger. This study investigates the effect of sensory stimulation on multiple segments and joints of the upper limb. It denotes the observation regarding the effect's continuity after halting the stimulation. 18 patients with essential tremor (8 men and 10 women) participated in this study. The task, \"arms stretched forward\", was performed and sensory electrical stimulation was applied on four muscles of the upper limb (Flexor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Radialis, Biceps Brachii, and Triceps Brachii) for 15 seconds. Three 3-D gyro sensors were used to measure the angular velocities of segments (finger, hand, and forearm) and joints (metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints) for three phases of pre-stimulation (Pre), during-stimulation (On), and 5 minute post-stimulation (P5). Three characteristic variables of root-mean-squared angular velocity, peak power, and peak power frequency were derived from the vector sum of the sensor signals. At On phase, RMS velocity was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints while peak power was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints except for forearm segment. Sensory stimulation showed no effect on peak power frequency. All variables at P5 were similar to those at On at all segments and joints. The decrease of peak power of the index finger was noted by 90% during stimulation from that of On phase, which was maintained even after 5 min. The results indicate that sensory stimulation may be an effective clinical method to treat the essential tremor.",

Simultaneous stretching of the fingers in addition to the wrist flexion has also been applied. However, the mechanism of this simultaneous stretching has not been clarified. This study is designed to clarify the mechanism underlying this simultaneous stretching technique based on the anatomical features of the origins of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and extensor digitorum communis (EDC).Thirty-nine arms from formalin-embalmed Japanese human specimens were dissected. The features of the origins of the ECRB and EDC were macroscopically observed, and the locations of each origin on the lateral epicondyle were measured.The ECRB had a long and wide, purely tendinous origin which originated from the anterior slope of the lateral epicondyle. The tendinous origin of the index finger of the EDC (EDC-IF) arose from the posterior aspect of the ECRB tendinous origin, with a coexisting muscular portion observed at the level of the proximal forearm. The middle finger of the EDC (EDC-MF) had a short tendinous origin with an associated muscular portion and originated proximo-laterally to the origin of the ECRB on the lateral epicondyle. In addition, the muscular origin of the EDC-MF arose on the superficial and posterior aspect of the ECRB tendinous origin. In contrast, the ring and little fingers of the EDC originated from the tendinous septum of the extensor digiti minimi and extensor carpi ulnaris, and had no connection with the ECRB tendinous origin.On the basis of our anatomical findings, simultaneous stretching of the wrist extensors by wrist, index and middle fingers flexion could provide stretching force to both the tendinous origins of the ECRB and EDC through the EDC-IF and EDC-MF.",

The variables were assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale and Barthel Index.The search was performed in the PUBMED, COCHRANE Library, PEDro, Dialnet, CSIC, CINAHL, databases. Search terms included the combination of keywords \"acupuncture\"; \"muscle spasticity\"; \"stroke\".Passive resistance to stretching, the degree of personal dependence, and motor function of the affected limb showed statistically significant improvements in at least one study included; however, these improvements are not clinically relevant changes.

          "abstract": "Torque motor produced stretch of upper limb muscles results in two distinct reflex peaks in the electromyographic activity. Whereas the short-latency reflex (SLR) response is mediated largely by the spinal monosynaptic reflex pathway, the longer-latency reflex (LLR) is suggested to involve a transcortical loop. For the SLRs, patterns of heteronymous monosynaptic Ia connections have been well-studied for a large number of muscles in the cat and in humans. For LLRs, information is available for perturbations to proximal joints, although the protocols for most of these studies did not focus on heteronymous connections. The main objective of the present study was to elicit both SLRs and LLRs in wrist flexors and extensors and to examine heteronymous connections from these muscles to elbow flexors (biceps brachii; BiBr) and extensors (triceps brachii; TriBr) and to selected distal muscles, including abductor pollicis longus (APL), first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and Thenars. The stretch of wrist flexors produced SLR and LLR peaks in APL, FDI, ADM, Thenars, and BiBr while simultaneously inducing inhibition of wrist extensors and TriBr. When wrist extensors were stretched, SLR and LLR peaks were observed in TriBr, whereas the primary wrist flexors, APL and BiBr, were inhibited; response patterns of FDI, ADM, and Thenars were less consistent. The main conclusions from the observed data are that: 1) as in the cat, afferents from wrist flexors and extensors make heteronymous connections with proximal and distal upper limb muscles; and 2) the strength of heteronymous connections is greater for LLRs than SLRs in the distal muscles, whereas the opposite is true for the proximal muscles. In the majority of observations, SLR and LLR excitatory peaks were observed together. However, on occasion, LLRs were observed without the SLR response in hand muscles when wrist extensors were stretched.",

          "abstract": "Gripping force is produced by co-contraction of forearm flexors and extensors. Activation of extensors is important for stabilizing the wrist during gripping. However, forearm muscle function is complicated and the neurophysiological mechanism responsible for the gain in gripping force is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether increasing forearm extensor activation with isometric wrist extension training has an effect on gripping force. Thirteen healthy subjects participated in this study. Maximal voluntary contraction of gripping was measured using a piezosensor (MVC(grip)) and EMG of forearm muscles at every wrist angle (from 70° flexion to 80° extension with 10° intervals) were measured simultaneously at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after training. Training consisted of 30 repetitions equal to 70% MVC of isometric wrist extension for 8 weeks (5/week) on the right side. Gripping force was measured on both sides using a grip dynamometer without wrist angle restriction. Gripping force, EMG, maximal wrist extension force, and wrist angle-gripping force curve were investigated after training. After training, maximal wrist extension force increased significantly. Gripping force on the trained side also increased significantly. The training changed wrist angle at peak of MVC(grip). EMG activation of forearm extensors increased and that of flexors decreased during gripping. These results suggest that wrist extension training leads to an increase in gripping force and changes the balance of EMG activation between forearm flexors and extensors during gripping. Therefore, this training method should be useful as a therapeutic strategy for increasing grip strength.",

Guidelines for treatment might be extracted from this analysis.Among 152 cases of traumatic lesion of the brachial plexus presented to our clinic, 58 underwent primary brachial plexus reconstructive surgery. On exploration, all patients showed stretching and scarring of plexus elements; root avulsions were found in 28 patients (48%). Outcome evaluation was carried out in 49 of these patients with a follow-up period of 1 year or longer (mean follow-up, 27.9 mo; range, 12-72 mo). A total of 43 secondary reconstructive procedures to improve functionality of the involved arm were performed at a later stage in 25 of 58 patients. Outcomes of the secondary functional restorative procedures were evaluated (mean follow-up, 11.5 mo; range, 3-60 mo in 43 procedures).Patients with neurolysis as a stand-alone procedure (11 patients) showed an outcome grade of 4 or 5. The average outcome of the 19 patients with C5, C6, and C7 grafting was Grade 3, the same as in patients with nerve transfers to the upper plexus elements (C5-C6 root avulsions, 13 patients). Patients with multiple root avulsions (five cases) showed an overall poor outcome (Grades 0-2). Secondary functional restorative surgery was performed in 43% of the patients and helped improve individual outcomes, providing a favorable effect on the general functionality of the arm. Among the restorative operations performed, the Steindler procedure, wrist extension restoration, claw hand correction, and free functional muscle flap transfer to the arm and forearm were the most rewarding.A combination of primary brachial plexus reconstruction and carefully evaluated, selected, and planned function-restorative secondary procedures might offer favorable outcomes in patients with partial or total brachial plexus lesions.",

In 12 young healthy subjects, MSNA, ECG, and blood pressure were recorded. Subjects performed static fatiguing isometric handgrip at 30% maximum voluntary contraction followed by 4 min of postexercise muscle ischemia (PEMI). After 2 min of PEMI, wrist extension (i.e., wrist dorsiflexion) was performed. The static stretch protocol was also performed during 1) a freely perfused condition, 2) ischemia alone, and 3) PEMI after nonfatiguing exercise. Finally, repetitive short bouts of wrist extension were also performed under freely perfused conditions. This last paradigm evoked transient increases in MSNA but had no significant effect on mean MSNA over the whole protocol. During the PEMI after fatiguing handgrip, static stretch induced significant increases in MSNA (552 +/- 74 to 673 +/- 90 U/min, P < 0.01) and mean blood pressure (102 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.001). Static stretch performed under the other three conditions had no significant effects on mean MSNA and blood pressure. The present data verified that in healthy humans mechanoreceptor(s) stimulation evokes significant increases in mean MSNA and blood pressure when muscle metabolite concentrations are increased above a certain threshold.",

Patient charts were reviewed retrospectively. The LSUHSC grading system was used to evaluate the function of muscles supplied by the AIN. Nontraumatic injuries included seven AIN compressions by bone or soft tissue. Traumatic injury mechanisms consisted of stretch or contusion (six patients), injection (one patient), and burn scar (one patient). Presentations included weakness in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscle to the index finger, FDP muscle to the middle finger, pronator quadratus muscle, and flexion of the distal phalanx of the thumb. Preoperative evaluations included electromyography and nerve conduction studies as well as elbow and forearm plain radiographs. On surgery, lesions in continuity involved seven compressions, four stretch or contusion injuries, and one injection injury, all of which demonstrated nerve action potentials (NAPs) and were treated with neurolysis. Among the seven compression and four stretch or contusion injury cases, six and three patients, respectively, had LSUHSC Grade 3 or better functional recoveries postoperatively. Two stretch or contusion injuries involved lesions in continuity but demonstrated negative NAPs at surgery. Thus, each was treated using a graft repair after resection of a neuroma. There was one burn scar injury, which was treated via an end-to-end suture anastomosis, leading to a functional recovery better than Grade 3.Fifteen AIN entrapments or injuries responded favorably to nerve release and/or repair.",

          "abstract": "The objective was to confirm the hypothesis that shortening reaction (ShoRe), normally occurring on forcibly shortening a muscle, is depressed or delayed in post-stroke patients. Eight post-stroke patients and ten age-matched normal subjects had a 50 degrees wrist extension or flexion induced by a torque-motor in the affected and the non-affected upper limb. Patients were instructed either not to intervene or to assist displacement (reaction-time condition, RT). Frequency of occurrence and latency of stretch reflex (SR) and ShoRe, and RTs were measured from the electromyograms (EMG) of wrist flexor (FCR) and extensor (ECR) muscles. SR had higher than normal frequency in both muscles. ShoRe disappeared in ECR on the affected side but had normal frequency in FCR of both sides. ShoRe latency was prolonged in FCR and ECR, in both affected and unaffected sides. RTs were prolonged in both FCR and ECR, in both affected and unaffected sides. Across all patients, RTs and ShoRe latencies in the FCR were correlated. Neither RTs nor ShoRe latencies were correlated to Ashworth score. RTs were inversely correlated to Medical Research Council scores. The decreased and delayed ShoRe in post-stroke patients supports a role for the cortico-spinal pathway in its production or modulation. Monitoring of ShoRe can give insight into the recovery of the descending control of spinal reflexes.",

The follow-up rehabilitation techniques included the use of active and passive stretching, therapeutic putty, and light dumbbells. The patient was seen a total of 21 times during a 9-week time period. Outcome assessments were given intermittently during care to monitor progress. At the end of the program, she reported full function of the wrist with minimal to no pain. A 6-month follow-up showed improvements that were maintained with little pain.Avascular necrosis of the capitate is relatively rare. Advanced imaging should be used for diagnostic purposes.

          "abstract": "Rhythmic movements brought about by the contraction of muscles on one side of the body give rise to phase-locked changes in the excitability of the homologous motor pathways of the opposite limb. Such crossed facilitation should favour patterns of bimanual coordination in which homologous muscles are engaged simultaneously, and disrupt those in which the muscles are activated in an alternating fashion. In order to examine these issues, we obtained responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to stimulation of the cervicomedullary junction (cervicomedullary-evoked potentials, CMEPs), to peripheral nerve stimulation (H-reflexes and f-waves), and elicited stretch reflexes in the relaxed right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle during rhythmic (2 Hz) flexion and extension movements of the opposite (left) wrist. The potentials evoked by TMS in right FCR were potentiated during the phases of movement in which the left FCR was most strongly engaged. In contrast, CMEPs were unaffected by the movements of the opposite limb. These results suggest that there was systematic variation of the excitability of the motor cortex ipsilateral to the moving limb. H-reflexes and stretch reflexes recorded in right FCR were modulated in phase with the activation of left FCR. As the f-waves did not vary in corresponding fashion, it appears that the phasic modulation of the H-reflex was mediated by presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. The observation that both H-reflexes and f-waves were depressed markedly during movements of the opposite indicates that there may also have been postsynaptic inhibition or disfacilitation of the largest motor units. Our findings indicate that the patterned modulation of excitability in motor pathways that occurs during rhythmic movements of the opposite limb is mediated primarily by interhemispheric interactions between cortical motor areas.",

Stiffness was measured with indices (passive stiffness index (ISI) and total stiffness index (TSI) obtained by mechanical wrist displacements induced by a torque motor,which could also provide the stretch reflex threshold speed (SRTS) from flexor muscles. Functional status was measured with the Barthel index and a specific hand ability scale, pain with a visual analogue scale (VAS). The ranges of voluntary wrist extension (EROM) and flexion (FROM) and wrist isometric extension and flexion (IE-IF) strength were also calculated.IE and EROM significantly increased, being respectively p < 0.01 and p < 0.05; also SRTS was augmented (p < 0.001),while TSI showed lower values (p < 0.001); the Ashworth score decreased at least one point. Hand function for selected tasks improved in 50% of patients, the Barthel index only in 4 (22 %), forearm pain was completely relieved in 3 patients (17 %).BT can be considered a valid therapeutic tool in all spastic patients, because of immediate advantages: reduction of muscle hypertonia, pain relief, improvement in selected motor performances.",

Responses to TMS were recorded in the flexor and extensor carpi radialis muscles (FCR, ECR) after conditioning with a rapid wrist extension movement. The cortical stimuli were timed to elicit a motor-evoked potential (MEP) at either the SLSR or LLSR onset in the FCR muscle. Responses were also collected in TMS-alone and stretch reflex-alone conditions. Six intensities of magnetic stimulation were applied in all conditions. In the FCR muscle, MEP amplitude when timed to arrive at the LLSR onset was significantly greater than the sum of the MEP and stretch reflex responses when given separately. MEP amplitudes at the SLSR onset in the FCR muscle and in the ECR muscle at both SLSR and LLSR onset were not significantly different from that expected from the sum of the two stimuli given separately. This indicates heightened corticospinal excitability at a time corresponding to the passage of an afferent volley induced by the stretch, and raises the possibility of a transcortical loop of the LLSR in the forearm. The extent of MEP facilitation was generally consistent across all stimulus intensities tested.

Physiopathologically, spasticity is due to the medullar and supramedullar alteration of the afferent and efferent pathways. Treatment is multidisciplinary and involves the collaboration of rehabilitators, neurophysiologists, neurologists, paediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons and psychologists, who all contribute with their different therapeutic aspects and characteristics (which can be pharmacological, peripheral neurological blockages, surgical, etc.). The characteristic posture of the upper extremities in spastic cerebral palsy is the inward rotation of the shoulder, flexion of the elbow and pronated forearm, and the deformity of the fingers (swan-neck and thumbs-in-palm). The primary objectives in these patients will be to improve communication with their surroundings, perform activities of daily living, increase mobility and walking.The surgical treatment applied by orthopaedic surgeons in the upper extremities are aimed at achieving an enhanced adaptive functionality rather than morphological normality. Factors to be taken into account include age, voluntary control over muscles and joints, level of severity of the spasticity (Ashworth scale) and stereognostic sensitivity. In general, on soft parts we will use procedures such as dehiscence or lengthening of the flexor muscles of the shoulder and elbow or of the adductor of the thumb; transfer of the pronators in order to adopt the supinating function or of the flexors so as to reinforce the extensors of the forearm, and capsulodesis or tenodesis in the hand. The bony procedures will consist in derotational osteotomies of the humerus and radius and arthrodesis in the wrist or in the metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumb, depending on whether there is greater rigidity or age in the former cases or instability in the latter.",

          "abstract": "A 43-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to unstable walking, head tilting to the left and difficulty in extending his arm. He was quite healthy until the age of 20 years, when these symptoms appeared and progressed slowly afterward. Due to his unstable walking, he started to use a wheelchair when he was 39 years old. He had no family history of similar disease. On admission, neurological examination revealed spasmodic torticollis, ataxic speech and marked limb and truncal ataxia. Myoclonic jerky flexion of the forearm was induced when he raised and extended his forearm. He also showed mild hyperreflexia in the lower limbs without pathological reflexes. He had weakness and atrophy of the left supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid and biceps brachii muscles and mild superficial sensory impairment in the left axillary nerve territory due to cervical spondylotic radiculopathy of the left C5 root. MRI of the brain demonstrated severe bilateral atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis but minimal atrophy of the cerebrum and brainstem. Because surface electromyography revealed continuous discharge with phasic components in the biceps and wrist flexor muscles on extending the upper limbs, the jerky flexion movement of the forearm was considered to be primarily dystonia. Although no giant SEP was observed, a C-response was detected in the long-loop reflex in response to right median nerve stimulation. Nuclear examinations showed diffuse hypoperfusion and decreased glucose metabolism in the cerebellum. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that cerebellar dysfunction may have induced severe dystonic movement resembling myoclonus. We would like to name this complicated involuntary movement an \"arm thrust\". This is the first case to be reported of sporadic, chronic, progressive cerebellar ataxia accompanied by severe dystonic movement, especially on stretching the forearms, that mimics myoclonic movement.",

          "abstract": "1. Single unit activity was recorded with the microneurography technique from sixteen spindle afferents and one Golgi tendon organ afferent originating from the forearm extensor muscles. Impulse rates were studied while subjects performed unobstructed aiming movements at the wrist in eight different directions 45 deg apart. In addition, similar imposed movements were performed while the subject was instructed to remain relaxed. Movement amplitudes were about 5 deg and the speed 10-30 deg x s(-1). Joint movements were translated to movements of a cursor on a monitor to provide visual feedback. 2. Individual spindle afferents modulated their activity over a number of targets, i.e. were broadly tuned, during these aiming movements. The preferred direction for a spindle afferent was the same during both passive and active movements, indicating that the fusimotor effects associated with active contractions had little or no effect on the direction of tuning. 3. The direction of tuning of individual spindle afferents could be predicted from the biomechanically inferred length changes of the parent muscle. Thus spindle afferents responded as stretch receptors, i.e. impulse rates increased with lengthening and decreased with shortening, in active as well as passive movements. 4. Spindles from muscles, which continuously counteracted gravity exhibited a stretch response and directional tuning during the phase of movement alone whereas their position sensitivity was poor. In contrast, spindle afferents from the muscles that had no or minimal antigravity role were directionally tuned during both the dynamic and the static phase of the aiming task and their position sensitivity was substantially higher. 5. In spite of the limited data base from three extensor muscles it could be demonstrated that wrist joint position was remarkably well encoded in the ensemble muscle spindle data.

The LLR of the contralesional forearm was studied at baseline and 2-3 months after surgery while patients continued to take their optimal medical regimens ('on' period). Patients were instructed not to respond to the perturbation (passive mode) or to oppose the mechanical extensor perturbation (active mode).The stretch reflex evoked by extension perturbations of the wrist consisted of a short-latency reflex (M1) and an LLR (M2). Pallidotomy had no effects on the size of M1 components in both passive and active mode and on that of M2 component in the passive mode, however, it significantly reduced M2 component in the active mode (P<0.05). The inherent muscle stiffness over 60 ms period of mechanical stretch was not influenced by pallidotomy in any experimental condition (preoperative vs. postoperative or passive mode vs. active mode). The hand displacement following M2 component increased significantly after pallidotomy in both passive (P<0.005) and active mode (P<0.05). The inverted value of the displacement following M2 component correlated with the size of M2 component (r=0.60, P<0.001).Pallidotomy decreased the transcortical reflex gain, probably at cortical level, and consequently reduced muscle stiffness.",

A torque motor induced 50 degrees wrist extension or flexion at 500 degrees /s. The subjects were relaxed or exerted a 10% maximal voluntary contraction. They were instructed either not to intervene, or to oppose the displacement, or else to assist it. Several trials were repeated at different initial angles.We found a short-latency reflex (SR) in the stretched muscle, be it flexor or extensor, and a later inconstant ShoRe in the antagonist. ShoRe latency was compatible with that of a reaction time (RT), and was not influenced by the initial wrist angle. When subjects assisted the movement, the EMG burst in the shortening muscle was in every respect a RT; when they opposed the movement, the ShoRe disappeared. There was a strict temporal relationship between SR duration and ShoRe latency.We suggest that the brain would deliberately trigger the ShoRe on recognizing the displacement direction. The occurrence of such activity in the shortened muscle makes the SR to abruptly stop. The temporal relationship between the duration of the SR and onset of the ShoRe can be an expression of the inhibition on the SR burst by the cortical drive to the antagonist muscle being shortened, possibly through the action of spinal inhibitory interneurones. The ShoRe would complete the movement momentarily braked by the SR and redistribute the muscle tone across antagonists, appropriate for the new muscle length.",

Patients were evaluated after overnight withdrawal of medication before and 3 months after unilateral pallidotomy. Surgery had no effect on initiation time in unwarned simple and choice reaction time tasks, whereas movement time measured during the same tasks was improved for the contralesional hand. Movement times also improved for isometric and isotonic ballistic movements. In contrast, repetitive, distal and fine movements measured in finger-tapping and pegboard tasks were not improved after pallidotomy. Preparatory processes were investigated using both behavioural and electrophysiological measures. A precued choice reaction time task suggested an enhancement of motor preparation for the contralesional hand. Similarly, movement-related cortical potentials showed an increase in the slope of the late component (NS2) when the patients performed joystick movements with the contralesional hand. However, no significant change was found for the early component (NS1) or when the patient moved the ipsilesional hand. The amplitude of the long-latency stretch reflex of the contralesional hand decreased after surgery. In summary, the data suggest that pallidotomy improved mainly the later stages of movement preparation and the execution of proximal movements with the contralesional limb.

To explore the basis of this increased activity, we have now recorded the late EMG responses together with associated cerebral responses following muscle stretch in parkinsonian patients. Nine patients and eight controls participated in two sets of experiments in which they grasped a handle attached to a torque motor and maintained the wrist isometrically against a constant flexor force. The force was changed unpredictably (first set) or predictably (second set of experiments), causing a stretch of wrist extensors or flexors. Cerebral responses and muscle responses from the forearm were recorded and averaged separately depending upon condition. The late muscle responses to unpredictable muscle stretch were enhanced in parkinsonian patients while the cerebral responses were attenuated when compared to controls. The alteration of the electrocerebral response began approx. 25 ms prior to the late M2 muscle response. Both controls and patients showed a markedly attenuated cerebral response when the muscle stretch was predictable. These results indicate that the electrocerebral response to muscle stretch is altered prior to the onset of M2 in patients with Parkinson's disease, and suggest that these cerebral events reflect components of a long-latency transcerebral reflex pathway that is affected in this disorder.",

Symptomatic tremor was confined to the upper limbs and was broadly symmetrical.

Magnetic brain stimulation, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and stretch reflex studies did not provide evidence for delayed conduction within central pathways. There was marked slowing of the maximum motor conduction velocities in peripheral nerves. Forearm stretch reflexes were present but their latencies were prolonged. Somatosensory evoked potentials were obtained in the majority of patients, but were delayed. Wrist tremor could be modulated by mechanical perturbations or median nerve electrical shocks. Simple voluntary wrist movements were of normal duration and peak velocity, but the kinematic profile was asymmetric. Each movement was associated with a triphasic EMG pattern in agonist-antagonist-agonist muscles but the durations of the bursts were prolonged and the onset of the second agonist was delayed.

          "abstract": "Eccentric activities are an important component of physical conditioning and everyday activities. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) can result from strenuous eccentric tasks and can be a limiting factor in motor performance for several days after exercise. An efficacious method of treatment for DOMS would enhance athletic performance and hasten the return to activities of daily living. The purpose of this study was to identify a treatment method which could assist in the recovery of DOMS. In the selection of treatment methods, emphasis was directed toward treatments that could be rendered independently by an individual, therefore making the treatment valuable to an athletic trainer in team setting. DOMS was induced in 70 untrained volunteers via 15 sets of 15 eccentric contractions of the forearm extensor muscles on a Lido isokinetic dynamometer. All subjects performed a pilot exercise bout for a minimum of 9 weeks before data collection to assure that DOMS would be produced. Data were collected on 15 dependent variables: active and passive wrist flexion and extension, forearm girth, limb volume, visual analogue pain scale, muscle soreness index, isometric strength, concentric and eccentric wrist total work, concentric and eccentric angle of peak torque. Data were collected on six occasions: pre- and post-induced DOMS, 20 minutes after treatment, and 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 7 groups (6 treatment and 1 control). Treatments included a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, high velocity concentric muscle contractions on an upper extremity ergometer, ice massage, 10-minute static stretching, topical Amica montana ointment, and sublingual A. montana pellets. A 7 x 6 ANOVA with repeated measures on time was performed on the delta values of each of the 15 dependent variables. Significant main effects (p < .05) were found for all of the dependent variables on time only. There were no significant differences between treatments. Therefore, we conclude that none of the treatments were effective in abating the signs and symptoms of DOMS. In fact, the NSAID and A. montana treatments appeared to impede recovery of muscle function.",

          "title": "Response patterns and postspike effects of premotor neurons in cervical spinal cord of behaving monkeys.",
          "abstract": "Most of our information about spinal neurons has been derived from experiments with anesthetized or surgically. reduced preparations. To investigate these neurons under normal behavioral conditions, we recorded the activity of single afferent units in cervical dorsal root ganglia and of single interneurons in the cervical spinal cord of macaque monkeys, as they generated alternating flexion and extension torques about the wrist. Spike-triggered averages of rectified electromyographic activity were used to identify \"premotor\" (PreM) units associated with correlated postspike effects in active muscles. In addition to postspike effects, some spike-triggered averages showed early increases in average muscle activity, which were attributed to synchronous discharges in other PreM units. In recordings of peripheral afferents, 49% of the task-related dorsal root ganglia units produced postspike facilitation (PSF) of at least one forearm muscle, with a mean PSF latency of 5.8 +/- 0.3 ms (SE). The PSF amplitude was measured as the mean percent increase (MPI): the average increase of the PSF as a percentage of the prespike baseline mean. PreM afferent units produced PSF with an average MPI of 4.6 +/- 0.3%. In a study of cervical interneurons, about 13% (72/562) of the task-related cells showed postspike effects. These PreM interneurons had a mean PSF latency of 7.2 +/- 0.3 ms and a mean MPI of 4.6 +/- 0.2%. The MPI values for spinal neurons were similar to the MPIs reported for rubromotoneuronal and corticomotoneuronal cells. PreM neurons usually facilitated a subset of the coactivated muscles called the unit's \"muscle field.\" The PreM afferents facilitated an average of 46% of the synergistically coactivated muscles, while PreM interneurons facilitated an average of 37%. These are comparable with the percentage of muscles facilitated by corticomotoneuronal (40%) and rubromotoneuronal (50%) cells. During the step-tracking task the monkeys generated ramp-and-hold torques about the wrist. The PreM afferents typically became active during either flexion or extension of the wrist, although a few were bidirectionally active. The most common response pattern in PreM afferents was a tonic discharge, followed by phasic and phasic-tonic discharge. The most common patterns exhibited by PreM interneurons were tonic and phasic-tonic responses. PreM afferent units began to discharge on average 51 +/- 13 ms before activation of their target muscle. This early onset supports our hypothesis that these PreM afferents arose from muscle spindles, which is also consistent with their short-latency PSF and their responses to perturbations that stretched their target muscles. The results reveal some salient differences between the discharge properties of dorsal root ganglia neurons, spinal interneurons, and supraspinal PreM cells in the motor cortex and red nucleus. All four PreM populations include tonic, phasic-tonic, and phasic cells, but in significantly different proportions. Most PreM afferents resembled corticomotoneuronal cells in being active only with their target muscles, unlike rubromotoneuronal cells and spinal PreM interneurons, which tended to exhibit more bidirectional discharges.",

          "abstract": "This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of manual therapy alone and a combination of it and TECAR (Transfer Energy Capacitive and Resistive) therapies on the conditions of pain, disability, and neck range of motion (ROM) in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (NCNP).In this Randomized controlled study, 30 women with non-specific chronic neck pain were randomly divided into two groups: Manual therapy along with TECAR therapy (intervention group) and single manual therapy (control group). The participants were homogenized in terms of age, height, and weight. Both groups received manual therapy for two weeks and a total of 8 sessions. Furthermore, self-stretching the scalene muscles, upper trapezius, and suboccipital muscles was taught to the participants. After the treatment ended, patients were followed up for two weeks. The primary outcomes in this study were pain and disability. The pain was measured with the VAS index, and disability was measured with two questionnaires, namely the neck disability index (NDI) and neck pain disability scale (NPDS). The secondary outcomes in this study were neck flexion and extension AROM measured with a goniometer. Pain was evaluated in four stages, including before the treatment onset, at the end of session 4, at the end of treatment and after a two-week follow-up, and other conditions were measured in three stages including before the treatment onset, at the end of treatment and after a two-week follow-up. The Repeated Measure ANOVA (2*3), the Wilcoxon test, and the Paired Student's t-test were used. The significance level was set at P ˂ 0.05.The comparison of the two groups indicated that at the end of the treatment period and after the follow-up, the average pain level in the intervention group was lower than that of the control group. The effect size also revealed that the combination of manual and TECAR therapies acts effectively in pain reduction. Furthermore, the combinatorial treatment compared to the single manual therapy was preferable to improving the disability, while after the two-week follow-up period, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups. The comparison of neck flexion and extension AROM did not reveal any difference between the two groups. The intragroup comparison also revealed that both the control and intervention groups experienced a significant decrease in pain intensity and disability level and a significant increase in neck flexion and extension AROM after the end of treatment and after a two-week follow-up compared to before the treatment (P> 0.05).Based on the results of this study, TECAR seems to be able to increase the effectiveness of manual treatments as a thermal modality.© 2024 Iran University of Medical Sciences.",

          "abstract": "Myofascial stretching is often prescribed in the management of musculoskeletal pain. However, the neural mechanisms contributing to a decrease in pain are unknown. Stretching produces a sensation that may act as a conditioning stimulus in a conditioned pain modulation response. The purpose of this study was to compare immediate changes in pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) during a low-intensity stretch, moderate-intensity stretch, and cold water immersion task. A secondary purpose was to examine if personal pain sensitivity and psychological characteristics were associated with the responses to these interventions. Twenty-seven (27) healthy participants underwent a cross-over study design in which they completed a cold water immersion task, upper trapezius stretch to the onset of the stretch sensation, and a moderate-intensity stretch. A significant condition x time effect was observed (F (8,160) = 2.85, p < 0.01, partial eta2 = 0.13), indicating reductions in pain sensitivity were significantly greater during a cold water immersion task compared to moderate-intensity stretching at minutes two and four. Widespread increases in heat pain threshold and lower pain-related anxiety were moderately correlated with the response to the cold water immersion task but not stretching. Moderate-intensity stretching may not elicit a conditioned pain modulation response possibly because the stretch was not intense enough to be perceived as painful.© 2024 by the authors.",

          "abstract": "Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60-90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001).

This study aims to examine the effects of different muscle relaxation techniques on the physical properties of the trapezius muscle and to explore how changes in the physical properties of the upper trapezius muscle affect those of the middle trapezius muscle. Twenty-four healthy males (mean age: 23.08 ± 0.97 years; height: 172.42 ± 4.61 cm; weight: 66.38 ± 6.68 kg; and body mass index: 22.30 ± 1.81 kg/m2), randomly divided into four groups: stretching relaxation group (ST, n = 6), mechanical vibration massage (MV, n = 6), pulse massage (PU, n = 6), and control (CO, n = 6). Measurements using the Myoton digital muscle assessment system were conducted daily over 2 weeks. The experimental groups demonstrated a notable decrease in tension and stiffness, accompanied by heightened elasticity in the upper trapezius muscles. Conversely, the control group exhibited contrasting trends. Although no significant variances were detected among the relaxation techniques, all proved efficacious compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, relaxation of the upper trapezius muscles significantly influenced the middle trapezius muscles (P < 0.05).

          "abstract": "Round-shoulder posture (RSP) is a common postural condition, characterized by protraction, downward rotation, anterior tilting and internal rotation of the scapula. RSP can lead to shoulder dysfunction. Different methods have been proposed for rehabilitating and correcting the altered posture in RSP including stretching, strengthening exercises, and shoulder brace or taping. However, the findings are controversial and studies are ongoing to develop more effective method. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of scapular posterior tilting (SPT) exercise in different support positions on scapular muscle activities in men and women with RSP. In a prospective observational clinical study, we assessed demographic, basic clinical parameters and study variables of the subjects with RSP (n = 20) (men/women = 9/11) attending Daegu University in Gyeongsan, South Korea. To do so, we compared electromyographic (EMG) activities of lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles between men and women with RSP during SPT exercise on four different support surfaces to determine any difference in the EMG activities. The results revealed that women showed significant differences in EMG activities in the lower and left upper trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, while men showed significant differences in EMG activity only in the lower trapezius muscle during SPT exercise on four different surfaces (P 0.0125).© 2024.

A total of 60 right-handed asymptomatic students participated in the study. Participants (N = 22) characterised by asymmetry in rotational movements were selected for the experimental group. A difference of ≥10° between right and left rotation of the cervical spine was considered asymmetrical. The control group (N = 38) included participants whose rotation difference was < 10°. Belonging to the experimental or control group did not significantly differentiate trapezius muscle stiffness. The rotation side differentiated the stiffness of the right and left trapezius muscles only in the group of people with rotational movement asymmetry. There were high correlation coefficients between right cervical rotation and the stiffness of the muscle on the right side, and between rotation to the left and the stiffness of the muscle on the left side. There is a relationship between the stiffness of the right and left upper trapezius muscles and the range of right and left rotational motion of the cervical spine. Stiffness of the upper trapezius correlates more strongly with rotation to the side on which the muscle lies than to the opposite side. Increased stiffness of the upper trapezius muscle on the side of limited cervical spine rotation is likely to be determined by the muscle fibre stretching mechanism.Copyright: © 2024 Wendt, Waszak.

Outcome measures were pain using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and quality of life assessment with EQ-5D-5l questionnaire. All participants were assessed by a blinded assessor before the intervention, immediately after, 10 and 30 min, one week, two weeks, four weeks, three months, and six months after the procedure. Data Analysis: Two-way mixed ANOVA and follow-up independent T-test were conducted for the outcome measures across several time points between the 2 groups.A total of 46 participants with two dropouts were all included during the final analysis. Both groups demonstrated significant differences in VAS scores between baseline and the different time points, the IH + SSE group demonstrated the more significant effect size at as compared to the DN + SSE group.

          "abstract": "Rounded shoulder posture (RSP) causes shoulder pain and can lead to shoulder impingement and thoracic outlet syndromes, ultimately resulting in a frozen shoulder. Altered scapular positions in RSP patients affect muscle activity. Many studies have explored methods to correct and prevent RSP, including shoulder braces, muscle strengthening, stretching, and inhibition techniques. Using a shoulder brace reduces RSP and improves shoulder discomfort and function, similar to conventional rehabilitation. However, despite their effectiveness, these braces are bulky and inconvenient, which makes continuous daily wear challenging. This is especially true for women who are sensitive to their appearance. To address this issue, methods have been developed to convert women's underwear bra straps into braces. This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of three underwear-mounted rounded shoulder braces and to identify the brace that is most effective in decreasing RSP and upper trapezius (UT) muscle activity and increasing lower trapezius (LT) muscle activity in patients with RSP. The study included 18 patients with an RSP. The RSP amount and UT and LT muscle activities were measured before and after three interventions. The interventions were scapular posterior tilting (SPT) exercises with the X strap, X + 8 strap, and inner brace. Compared with the baseline value, the RSP amount was significantly lower with the three braces. The RSP was significantly lower with the X + 8 strap and the inner brace than with the X strap. The inner brace showed significantly lower UT muscle activity than those with the X strap and X + 8 straps and significantly greater LT muscle activity than that with the X + 8 strap. These results show underwear-mounted braces as a potential RSP solution, but long-term sustainability and improving comfort, especially for those concerned about appearance, require further research and development.",

          "abstract": "Few reports have described multidisciplinary treatment, including extracorporeal shock wave therapy, for patients with refractory chronic tension-type headache. In this study, we conducted multidisciplinary treatment for a patient with chronic tension-type headache who suffered from chronic headache refractory to treatment.The patient was a 45-year-old Japanese male suffering from 20 years of headache. As his headache had worsened recently, he visited a local clinic. With the diagnosis of suspected tension-type headache, its treatment was unsuccessful and he was referred to our hospital. The neurology department confirmed the tension-type headache and prescribed another medication, but he showed no improvement. Then, the patient was referred to the rehabilitation medicine department for consultation. At the initial visit, we identified multiple myofascial trigger points in his bilateral posterior neck and upper back regions. At the initial visit, he was prescribed 10 mL of 1% lidocaine injected into the muscles in these areas. In addition, he received 2000 extracorporeal shock wave therapy into bilateral trapezius muscles, and was instructed to take oral Kakkonto extract granules, benfotiamine, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and cyanocobalamin. Cervical muscle and shoulder girdle stretches and exercises were also recommended. At follow-up treatment visits, we used extracorporeal shock wave therapy to bilateral trapezius muscles, which led to immediate pain relief. After 11 weeks, he was not taking any medication and his headache was subjectively improved and his medical treatment ended.A patient with chronic tension-type headache refractory to regular treatment was successfully treated with a multimodal approach including extracorporeal shock wave therapy in addition to standard treatment. For patients with tension-type headache accompanied by myofascial trigger points, it may be recommended to promptly consider aggressive multimodal treatment that includes extracorporeal shock wave therapy.© 2023.

The goal of the present study was to create a standardised TTM protocol to treat office syndrome (OS) diagnosed based on the identification of the palpation of at least one so-called myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in the upper trapezius muscle. The new 90 min TTM protocol, which was developed following appropriate review of the literature and in consultation with relevant experts, has 25 distinct steps (20 pressing steps, 2 artery occlusion steps, and 3 stretching steps). Eleven TTM therapists treated three patients each using the new 90 min TTM protocol. All of the therapists reported scores greater than 80% in respect to their satisfaction and confidence to deliver the protocol, and all of the patients gave the treatment a satisfaction score of greater than 80%. The treatment produced a significant reduction in pain intensity measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 10 cm, of 2.33 cm (95% CI (1.76, 2.89 cm), p < 0.001) and significant increase in pain pressure threshold (PPT) of 0.37 kg/cm2 (95% CI (0.10, 0.64 kg/cm2), p < 0.05).

          "title": "The Effect of Reciprocal Inhibition Techniques on Pain, Range of Motion, and Functional Activities in Patients With Upper Trapezitis.",
          "abstract": "Background and objective Upper trapezius can cause neck pain, and restrict functional activities and cervical range of motion (ROM), and hence its management should be part of a global rehabilitation program. Owing to the heterogeneity of the existing trials, various techniques of manual physical therapy might be potent, though the scope of their efficacy is currently unspecified. The reciprocal inhibition technique of the muscle energy technique (MET) works on both agonist as well antagonist muscles for the reduction of pain and to improve overall functional activities. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the reciprocal inhibition technique of MET on pain, cervical ROM, and functional activities in patients with upper trapezitis. Methods An interventional cross-sectional study involving 30 patients with neck pain due to upper trapezitis was conducted. The outcome measures were as follows: numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) score for pain intensity, universal goniometer for cervical ROM, and neck disability index (NDI) score for functional activities. The reciprocal inhibition technique involved a five-second hold, five-second rest, followed by stretching with a 10-60-second hold, with five repetitions. Patients were treated for five sessions a week for two weeks. Results Paired t-test was used to compare the group's mean values before and after therapy. Our findings revealed that NPRS score, cervical ROM, and NDI score notably improved (p=0.001). Conclusion The reciprocal inhibition technique of MET in patients with upper trapezitis showed significant improvement in neck pain, cervical movement, and functional activities. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate our findings.Copyright © 2023, Jawade et al.",

A total of sixty female participants with rounded shoulder postures were recruited and randomly allocated into groups 1 and 2 (n = 30/group). Each group performed supervised PMi-M stretching; however, group 2 performed a combination of LTr-M strengthening and PMi-M stretching. The outcomes, including rounded shoulder posture and SFROM, were assessed using the pectoralis minor length test (PMLT) and universal goniometer. A repeated measure ANOVA was used to compare the differences within-group and between-group for the outcomes measures at one-week (baseline) pre-intervention, two weeks, and three -weeks post-intervention. The significance level was set at q > 2.00 and p 2.00) in the outcomes of PMLT and SFROM when comparing their post-intervention scores to the baseline scores. The between-group comparison revealed a significant and an insignificant (q < 2.00) difference in the outcomes of PMLT and SFROM, respectively when comparing their scores at the second- and third-week post-intervention. Furthermore, the effect size of the intervention suggests an advantage of group 2 over group 1 in increasing the resting length of the PMi-M only among young Saudi females.The combined effect of LTr-M strengthening and PMi-M stretching was more beneficial than PMi-M stretching alone in correcting the rounded shoulder posture among young Saudi females by increasing PMi-M resting length.

          "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgery (LS) has been shown to provide great benefits to patients compared with open surgery. However, surgeons experience discomfort, low-efficiency, and even musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) because of the poor ergonomic design of laparoscopic instruments. A methodology for the ergonomic design of laparoscopic dissector handles considering three-dimensional (3D) hand anthropometry and dynamic hand positions was addressed in this research. Two types of hand positions for grasping and stretching were scanned from 21 volunteers using a high-resolution 3D scanner. The 3D anthropometric data were extracted from these 3D hand pose models and used to design an improved handle (IH) that provides additional support for the thumb, a better fit to the purlicue, and a more flexible grasp for the index finger. Thirty subjects were invited to evaluate the IH in terms of muscular effort, goniometric study of motion, and efficiency and effectiveness during four trials of a laparoscopic training task. Questionnaires provided subjective parameters for ergonomic assessment. Positive results included less muscle load in the trapezius as well as significant but small angular differences in the upper limb. No significant reduction in the trial time and no increased percentage of the achievement were observed between the IH and the commercial handle (CH). Improved intuitiveness, comfort, precision, stability, and overall satisfaction were reported. IH provides significant ergonomic advantages in laparoscopic training tasks, demonstrating that the proposed methodology based on 3D anthropometry is a powerful tool for the handle design of laparoscopic dissectors and other surgical instruments.",

          "abstract": "Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) is a relatively common stretch injury of the brachial plexus sustained during delivery. Tendon transfers are commonly performed to improve shoulder function among patients with OBPP. Although several techniques for the surgical management of OBPP exist, it is unclear whether tendon transfers to the rotator cuff vs. posterior humerus yield different outcomes.A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to January 1, 2021, was performed. Relevant publications were classified by surgical technique of tendon transfers to the rotator cuff or posterior humerus. The standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare preoperative and postoperative aggregate Mallet scores as well as abduction and external rotation scores using the Mallet scale. A p value of <0.01 was considered significant.Data from 26 studies and 951 patients (46.2% male patients) with a mean age of 68.9 ± 29.3 months were included. Eight hundred three patients underwent tendon transfer to the rotator cuff and 148 to the posterior humerus. The average postoperative follow-up period was 45.2 ± 21.7 months. The pooled cohort had an overall improvement in postoperative aggregate Mallet scores (SMD = 5.53, p < 0.001), abduction scores (SMD = 1.79, p < 0.001), and external rotation scores (SMD = 1.99, p < 0.001). Tendon transfer to the rotator cuff had a greater postoperative improvement in abduction (SMD = 1.90, p < 0.001) than transfer to the posterior humerus (SMD = 1.32, p < 0.001) while both techniques yielded similar improvements in external rotation (rotator cuff SMD = 2.01, p < 0.001, posterior humerus SMD = 1.98, p < 0.001).This is the first systematic review comparing outcomes for tendon transfers to the rotator cuff vs. the posterior humerus for improving shoulder function in patients with OBPP. Overall, tendon transfers are an effective treatment for improving shoulder function. Transfer of the latissimus dorsi and teres major to the rotator cuff compared with transfer to the posterior humerus results in greater improvement in abduction while both techniques have similar results in improving external rotation.Level I Systematic review of Level I and Level II studies.Copyright © 2023 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.",

          "abstract": "Spinal accessory nerve (SAN) palsy is typically a result of posterior triangle surgery and can present with partial or complete paralysis of the trapezius muscle and severe shoulder dysfunction. We share an atypical case of a patient who presented with SAN palsy following an injury sustained playing competitive volleyball. A 19-year-old right hand dominant competitive volleyball player presented with right shoulder weakness, dyskinesia, and pain. She injured the right shoulder during a volleyball game 2 years prior when diving routinely for a ball. On physical examination she had weakness of shoulder shrug and a pronounced shift of the scapula when abducting or forward flexing her shoulder greater than 90 degrees. Manual stabilization of the scapula eliminated this shift, so we performed scapulopexy to stabilize the inferior angle of the scapula. At 6 months postoperative, she had full active range of motion of the shoulder. SAN palsy can occur following what would seem to be a routine volleyball maneuver. This could be due to a combination of muscle hypertrophy from intensive volleyball training and stretch sustained while diving for a ball. Despite delayed presentation and complete atrophy of the trapezius, a satisfactory outcome was achieved with scapulopexy.The Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.

          "abstract": "Migraine patients have musculoskeletal disorders and pain in the cervical. And, despite the pathophysiology demonstrating the relationship between migraine and the cervical spine, the effectiveness of craniocervical exercises in these patients has not been verified. So, the aimed of this study was verify the effectiveness of craniocervical muscle-strengthening exercise (CMSE) in reducing the frequency and intensity of headache in migraine patients. METHODS: A two-armed, parallel-group randomized controlled trial with a 3-month follow-up was performed. For eight weeks, the volunteers in the intervention group (n = 21) performed a protocol of CMSE, while those in the sham ultrasound group (n = 21) received the application of disconnected therapeutic ultrasound in the upper trapezius and guideline for home-stretching. The primary outcomes were the frequency and intensity of the headache. The secondary outcomes were questionnaires about migraine and neck disability, and satisfaction with the treatment, cervical range of motion, the pressure pain threshold, craniocervical flexion test (CCFT), cervical muscle strength and endurance test, and the cervical muscle activity during the physical tests.No differences were observed for the changes observed in primary outcomes after eight weeks and at the 3-months follow up (p > 0.05). For the secondary outcomes, craniocervical exercises improved the sensitivity of the frontal muscle (p = 0.040) and promoted a reduced amplitude of muscle activity of the anterior scalene and upper trapezius in the last stages of CCFT (p ≤ 0.010). There was also reduced muscle activity of the anterior scalene and splenius capitis in the endurance test (p ≤ 0.045), as evaluated by surface electromyography.CMSE were insufficient in reducing the frequency and intensity of headache, improving the performance of the cervical muscles, or reducing migraine and neck pain-related disabilities. This was found despite a decreased electromyographic activity of the cervical muscles during the last stages of CCFT and increased median frequency during the endurance test.Accession code RBR-8gfv5j , registered 28/11/2016 in the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC).© 2022.

          "abstract": "Because of its superficial location in the dorsal regions of the scalp, the greater occipital nerve (GON) can be injured during neurosurgical procedures, resulting in post-operative pain and postural disturbances. The aim of this work is to specify the course of the GON and how its injuries can be avoided while performing posterior fossa approaches.This study was carried out at the department of anatomy at Bordeaux University. 4 specimens were dissected to study the GON course. Posterior fossa approaches (midline suboccipital, paramedian suboccipital, retrosigmoid and petrosal) were performed on 4 other specimens to assess potential risks of GON injuries.The GON runs around the obliquus capitis inferior (100%), crosses the semispinalis capitis (100%) and the trapezius (75%) or its aponeurosis (25%). Direct GON injuries can be seen in paramedian suboccipital approaches. Stretching of the GON can occur in midline suboccipital and paramedian suboccipital approaches. We found no evidence of direct or indirect GON injury in retrosigmoid or petrosal approaches.Our study provides interesting data regarding the risk GON injury in posterior fossa approaches. Direct GON injuries in paramedian suboccipital approaches can be avoided with careful dissection. Placing retractors in contact with the periosteum and performing a minimal retraction may help to avoid excessive GON stretching in midline suboccipital and paramedian suboccipital approaches. Furthermore, the incision for retrosigmoid approaches should be as lateral as possible and not too caudal. Finally, avoiding extreme patient positioning reduces the risk of GON stretching in all approaches.© 2022.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two different treatment programs: progressive resistance exercises plus manual therapy (PRE plus MT) and motor control exercises (MCE), on isometric strength of upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MTr), lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA), supraspinatus (Supr.), anterior deltoid (A.D), and latissimus dorsi (LD). 80 male university-level overhead athletes clinically diagnosed with SIS were randomly allocated into either of the two groups: PRE plus MT and MCE group. Athletes in the PRE plus MT group underwent graduated exercises with resistance elastic band, stretching exercises, and mobilization of the thoracic and shoulder joints. MCE group was submitted to motor control exercises in varied planar positions. Athletes in both groups underwent management 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Isometric strength of UT, MTr, LT, Supr, A.D, SA, and LD was measured at three-time points: baseline, 4th week, and 8th week. Relative to baseline, both interventions were found to be effective in increasing and optimizing the isometric strength of muscles (p 0.05). However, athletes in PRE plus MT group presented a more pronounced increase in isometric strength than those in the MCE group. Between groups analysis found the largest isometric strength improvement in PRE plus MT group for A.D, followed by Supr. and UT muscles (p < 0.05; effect size: 0.39 to 0.40).

          "abstract": "Spinal-muscle morphological differences between weight-bearing and supine postures have potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications. While the focus to date has been on cervical and lumbar regions, recent findings have associated spinal deformity with smaller paraspinal musculature in the thoracic region. We aim to quantitatively investigate the morphology of trapezius (TZ), erector spinae (ES) and transversospinalis (TS) muscles in upright postures with open upright MRI and also determine the effect of level and posture on the morphological measures.Six healthy volunteers (age 26 ± 6 years) were imaged (0.5 T MROpen, Paramed, Genoa, Italy) in four postures (supine, standing, standing with 30° flexion, and sitting). Two regions of the thorax, middle (T4-T5), and lower (T8-T9), were scanned separately for each posture. 2D muscle parameters such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and position (radius and angle) with respect to the vertebral body centroid were measured for the three muscles. Effect of spinal level and posture on muscle parameters was examined using 2-way repeated measures ANOVA separately for T4-T5 and T8-T9 regions.The TZ CSA was smaller (40%, P = .0027) at T9 than at T8. The ES CSA was larger at T5 than at T4 (12%, P = .0048) and at T9 than at T8 (10%, P = .0018). TS CSA showed opposite trends at the two spinal regions with it being smaller (16%, P = .0047) at T5 than at T4 and larger (11%, P = .0009) at T9 than at T8. At T4-T5, the TZ CSA increased (up to 23%), and the ES and TS CSA decreased (up to 10%) in upright postures compared to supine.Geometrical parameters that describe muscle morphology in the thorax change with level and posture. The increase in TZ CSA in upright postures could result from greater activation while upright. The decrease in ES CSA in flexed positions likely represents passive stretching compared to neutral posture.© 2021 The Authors.

This study was aimed to compare the efficacy of granisetron and lidocaine injections to trigger points of upper trapezius in the management of myofascial pain syndrome.We performed a double-blind randomized clinical trial in an outpatient clinic of physical medicine and rehabilitation at a teaching hospital. A total of 40 patients aged ≥18 with neck pain due to myofascial pain syndrome were included. They had pain for at least one month with the intensity of at least 30 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale. Each participant received a single dose of 1 mL lidocaine 2% or 1 mg (in 1 mL) granisetron. The solutions were injected into a maximum of three trigger points of the upper trapezius. We instructed all patients to remain active while avoiding strenuous activity for three or four days, and to perform stretch exercise and massage of their upper trapezius muscles. We assessed the patients before the interventions, and one month and three months post-injection. The primary outcome was the Neck Disability Index and the secondary outcome was the Neck Pain and Disability Scale.Both interventions were successful in reducing neck pain and disability (all p-values <0.001). However, the neck pain and disability responded more favorably to lidocaine than granisetron (p=0.001 for Neck Disability Index, and p=0.006 for Neck Pain and Disability Scale). No significant side-effect was recognized for both groups.Both lidocaine and granisetron injections to trigger points are effective and safe for the management of the syndrome and the benefits remain at least for three months. However, lidocaine is more effective in reducing pain and disability. The injections are well-tolerated, although a transient pain at the site of injections is a common complaint. One mL of lidocaine 2% is more effective than 1 mg (in 1 mL) granisetron for injecting into the trigger points of the upper trapezius in myofascial pain syndrome.© 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate effective trunk positions for stretching of the LD. A total of 14 healthy males participated in this study. The following seven trunk positions were chosen as the LD stretching positions; upright of the trunk (Baseline), flexion of the trunk (Flex), contralateral bending of the trunk (LB), contralateral rotation of the trunk (Rot), flexion and contralateral bending of the trunk (Flex + LB), flexion and contralateral rotation of the trunk (Flex + Rot), and contralateral bending and contralateral rotation of the trunk (LB + Rot). Maximal elevation of the upper limb was passively added to all positions. The shear elastic modulus, used as the index of muscle elongation, was measured at the four parts (upper, middle, lower, distal parts) of the LD. The shear elastic moduli showed obviously high values in Rot and LB + Rot at the upper, middle, and distal parts, and also in LB, Rot, and LB + Rot at the lower part. These findings suggest that contralateral trunk rotation, or a combination of contralateral trunk bending and rotation are effective trunk positions for stretching all parts of the LD.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a six week exercise program to reduce the muscle tone of the trapezius and musculoskeletal discomfort (MED) of office workers. Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67). In conclusion, MED appears to improve in office workers after a six week training program, which may be explained by a decrease in trapezius tone and increase in the left middle trapezius tone.",

However, a daily report of pain reduction has not been determined.The aim was to evaluate the time of the greatest pain relief after performing a single session of DN in MTrPs of the upper trapezius muscle.A patient who had MTrPs in the upper trapezius muscle was enrolled into a prospective descriptive study. Each patient received a single session of DN, using a fast-in-fast-out technique, with needle retention for 30 min. Numerical rating scale (NRS) scores were collected daily for 14 days. The mean difference of pain and an effect size were calculated. The 1-5 satisfaction score was a secondary outcome.Sixty-seven subjects completed the intervention. The mean duration of the symptom was 27.32 months. The mean baseline NRS score was 5.30. The pain decreased significantly between immediate post-procedure and 1 day after the DN treatment from 5.16 to 3.40 (mean difference 1.76, p < 0.01, effect size = 0.87).

Biomechanical Taping (BMT), a novel intervention, may provide equally effective management.This paper reports on the effectiveness of Biomechanical Taping compared with Kinesio Taping in improving shoulder pain, active range of motion (AROM), and function.Two groups of participants with TM were recruited through simple random sampling of participants from nine call centers and purposively-sampled participants from one fast-food chain and one community based rehabilitation center in Manila, Philippines. Participants were randomly allocated to either Kinesio Taping or biomechanical taping group in a double-blind clinical trial. Irrespective of the type of taping, participants performed gentle passive stretching of upper trapezius for six times each held for 30 s on Days 1, 3, and 5. On Days 2 and 4, participants performed gentle passive stretch of upper trapezius three times a day. Pre- and post-intervention measures were taken of Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity, AROM for shoulder movement, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand for function.Of 68 participants, 62 had shoulder symptoms secondary to TM. Similar significant within group improvements were found for Visual Analogue Scale scores, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand for biomechanical taping and Kinesio Taping interventions when comparing between group results (p < 0.05).Biomechanical Taping appears to be as effective as Kinesio Taping in the short term in decreasing pain and improving function of individuals with TM.

The aim of this study was to establish the diagnostic value of PET/CT and brain MRI in these patients, and to assess their influence on subsequent management decisions. In this prospective study, 25 melanoma patients with a first presentation of S&ITM who had no clinical evidence of palpable nodal or distant metastasis underwent whole-body F-FDG PET/CT and brain MRI after a tentative pre-scan treatment plan had been made. Sensitivity and specificity of imaging were determined by pathological confirmation, clinical outcome and repeat PET/CT and MRI at 6 months. PET/CT led to a modification of the initial treatment plan in four patients (16%). All four were upstaged (AJCC stage eighth edition). PET/CT was false-positive in one patient, who had a Schwannoma in his trapezius muscle. A thyroid carcinoma was an incidental finding in another patient. The sensitivity of PET/CT was 58% and specificity 83%. In 6 months following the baseline PET/CT, further sites of in-transit or systemic disease were identified in 10 patients (40%). Brain MRI did not alter the treatment plan or change the disease stage in any patient. Whole-body PET/CT improved staging in melanoma patients with S&ITM and changed the originally-contemplated treatment plan in 16%. MRI of the brain appeared not to be useful.",

Twenty-four healthy males (mean age: 23.08 ± 0.97 years; height: 172.42 ± 4.61 cm; weight: 66.38 ± 6.68 kg; and body mass index: 22.30 ± 1.81 kg/m2), randomly divided into four groups: stretching relaxation group (ST, n = 6), mechanical vibration massage (MV, n = 6), pulse massage (PU, n = 6), and control (CO, n = 6). Measurements using the Myoton digital muscle assessment system were conducted daily over 2 weeks. The experimental groups demonstrated a notable decrease in tension and stiffness, accompanied by heightened elasticity in the upper trapezius muscles. Conversely, the control group exhibited contrasting trends. Although no significant variances were detected among the relaxation techniques, all proved efficacious compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, relaxation of the upper trapezius muscles significantly influenced the middle trapezius muscles (P < 0.05).

          "abstract": "Few reports have described multidisciplinary treatment, including extracorporeal shock wave therapy, for patients with refractory chronic tension-type headache. In this study, we conducted multidisciplinary treatment for a patient with chronic tension-type headache who suffered from chronic headache refractory to treatment.The patient was a 45-year-old Japanese male suffering from 20 years of headache. As his headache had worsened recently, he visited a local clinic. With the diagnosis of suspected tension-type headache, its treatment was unsuccessful and he was referred to our hospital. The neurology department confirmed the tension-type headache and prescribed another medication, but he showed no improvement. Then, the patient was referred to the rehabilitation medicine department for consultation. At the initial visit, we identified multiple myofascial trigger points in his bilateral posterior neck and upper back regions. At the initial visit, he was prescribed 10 mL of 1% lidocaine injected into the muscles in these areas. In addition, he received 2000 extracorporeal shock wave therapy into bilateral trapezius muscles, and was instructed to take oral Kakkonto extract granules, benfotiamine, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and cyanocobalamin. Cervical muscle and shoulder girdle stretches and exercises were also recommended. At follow-up treatment visits, we used extracorporeal shock wave therapy to bilateral trapezius muscles, which led to immediate pain relief. After 11 weeks, he was not taking any medication and his headache was subjectively improved and his medical treatment ended.A patient with chronic tension-type headache refractory to regular treatment was successfully treated with a multimodal approach including extracorporeal shock wave therapy in addition to standard treatment. For patients with tension-type headache accompanied by myofascial trigger points, it may be recommended to promptly consider aggressive multimodal treatment that includes extracorporeal shock wave therapy.© 2023.

          "abstract": "The pain in the trapezius muscle is known as trapezius myalgia. The patient often complains of trapezius muscle soreness and tightness. Muscle soreness usually lasts for a few days, if not longer. This muscular rigidity and stiffness cause spasms in upper trapezius fibres, culminating in neck discomfort in the posterior side of the neck and shoulder area. This protocol was designed to describe the study to evaluate the effect of myofascial release (MFR) versus high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief and functional improvement in subjects with trapezius myalgia. Methods: Forty-five subjects with trapezius myalgia meeting inclusion criteria were selected for the study. Two groups were created, with group A undergoing MFR therapy and group B undergoing high-frequency TENS. The procedure was completed within four weeks. Regular assessments were carried out in the first week and fourth week of the rehabilitation. Throughout the recovery process, we evaluated pain, functional improvement, and range of motion of the neck at regular intervals. The outcome measures taken were the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Discussion: The intervention's efficacy was assessed by looking at pain alleviation using the outcome measures. The study's findings strongly supported the application of these approaches and modalities in the rehabilitation of myalgia patients.Copyright © 2022, Joshi et al.",

Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries.

          "abstract": "Chronic neck/shoulder pain (CNSP) is one of the most common pain conditions. The understanding of mechanisms, including the peripheral balance between nociceptive and antinociceptive processes, is incomplete. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a class of endogenous compounds that regulate inflammation and pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of two NAEs: the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type-α ligand palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and stearoylethanolamide (SEA) in the muscle interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP randomized to two different neck specific training programs and in a healthy pain-free control group (CON).Fifty-seven women with CNSP were randomized to strength + stretch or stretch alone exercise programs. Twenty-nine subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months of exercise. Twenty-four CON subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months without any intervention in between. Microdialysate samples were collected from the trapezius muscle and analyzed by mass spectrometry for PEA and SEA levels.PEA and SEA levels were significantly higher in CNSP patients compared with CON. PEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after both training programs. SEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after stretch alone but not after strength + stretch training. A significant positive correlation was found between changes in pain intensity and in SEA levels in the strength + stretch group, but not in the stretch alone group.Our results indicate that exercise interventions differentially affect the levels of the bioactive lipids PEA and SEA in the interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP.Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Thirty symptomatic VDU operators were randomly assigned to 2 active break groups (stretching and dynamic movement) and a reference group. The subjects performed the same typing task for 60 min and received 3-min breaks after each 20 min of work. Root mean square and median frequency were calculated for neck and shoulder muscle activity. Muscle discomfort was measured with Borg's CR-10 scale. Productivity was measured by counting words.There were no significant differences between the types of activities during breaks on neck and shoulder muscle activity, muscle discomfort or productivity. However, there was a significant difference in the level of muscle discomfort over time.Three types of activity during breaks showed a favourable effect on neck and shoulder muscle activity and productivity, and a positive effect on muscle discomfort in symptomatic VDU operators.",

Cosmetically unacceptable scars on the neck and compulsory functional exercises after surgery were also common problems. We applied the therapeutic principle of scar contracture to the surgical treatment of muscular torticollis. Surgical incision determination and the postoperative protocol were considerably improved. Satisfactory results were obtained.According to the therapeutic principle of scar contracture, complete release of the contracted muscles and peripheral streak fascia and release or partial resection of peripheral normal tissues such as the scalenus anterior, anterior trapezius border, platysma, and partial carotid sheath are required to release all the affected contracted and tightened tissues. We chose to incise underneath the affected side of the clavicular border. We obtained a tension-free closure of the incision through an advanced skin flap of the inferior incision sutured on the clavicular fascia. Maximum head and neck stretch to the unaffected side of the shoulder when the patient lied down gave the affected side lateral decubitus position after surgery.Satisfactory results were obtained and no complications were identified for all of the 104 patients. The development of craniofacial asymmetry and progressive deformities was prevented. The incision scar appeared linear in the pit above or below the clavicle border and was relatively inconspicuous.The application of the therapeutic principle of scar contracture to the surgical treatment of muscular torticollis was successful.",

          "abstract": "Retrospective case series.Spinal accessory nerve palsy (SANP) is common following neck dissection surgery and can occur with blunt or penetrating trauma to the lateral neck region and cervical stretch injuries. Early detection of SANP remains a clinical challenge and the condition is often misdiagnosed. The purpose of this case series is to describe the associated history, signs, and symptoms related to SANP and increase awareness of the scapular flip sign as a clinical sign associated with SANP. CASE SERIES DESCRIPTION: Twenty subjects (13 male, 7 female) presented with pain and decreased shoulder function following head and neck surgery or posttrauma. All patients were thoroughly examined and the scapular flip sign was assessed. All patients presented with a cluster of signs and symptoms including trapezius atrophy, shoulder girdle depression, limited active shoulder abduction to less than 90 degrees , shoulder pain, and shoulder weakness. A positive scapular flip sign was present in all cases. The middle and lower trapezius were rated as 0/5, based on manual muscle testing, indicating no identifiable muscle activation against resistance.A typical history and consistent signs and symptoms were found related to SANP. A strong relationship appeared between the presence of the scapular flip sign and SANP. The suspected mechanism for the scapular flip sign is the unopposed pull of the humeral external rotators by the inactive middle and lower trapezius. Early identification of SANP can assist with the prognosis, explain persistent impairments and functional deficits, motivate appropriate diagnostic testing and interventions, and help maximize outcome. Further research to validate the scapular flip sign and establish a clinical prediction rule for the diagnosis of SANP should be performed.",

          "abstract": "Although there have been studies on patients with persistent dizziness, physical findings have not been formerly focused. The aim of this study was to investigate localization and extent of physical dysfunctions in patients with long-lasting dizziness. To investigate physical change, we re-examined patients who had completed a vestibular rehabilitation (VR) programme.A longitudinal design was used. Patients with peripheral vestibular dysfunction were examined with the Global Physiotherapy Examination (GPE-52) and the Vertigo Symptom Scale-short form (VSS-SF). The GPE-52 consists of 52 standardized items within posture, respiration, movement, muscle and skin. Initially, 32 patients were included; 20 completed the VR programme. The programme, based upon traditional VR exercises combined with a body awareness approach, was administered as group sessions taking place once weekly for nine weeks.The majority of patients had a flexed head posture, and their respiration was restricted. Reduced flexibility, reduced ability to relax, measured with passive movements, and restricted range of motion (ROM) were found in about half of the patients in the neck, jaw, shoulder girdle and thorax. On palpation of muscles, 70-94% of the patients had reduced stretch in the abdominals/diaphragm, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and medial gastrocnemius muscles. After the VR programme, significant improvements (p < 0.05) were shown in the following areas: respiration, flexibility and passive movement tests in the shoulder and cervical region, and ROM in the neck and jaw. Significant improvement (p < 0.05) was also reported in the balance subscale of the VSS-SF.This study documents that postural changes, restricted respiration, lack of flexibility, ability to relax and reduced muscular stretch seem quite common in patients with dizziness.

          "abstract": "The supraclavicular (intermediate) and supra-acromial (lateral) branches of supraclavicular nerves contribute to the innervation of the thorax, shoulder, and neck. Despite their clinical and surgical interest, they are not often considered for descriptive anatomy. The goal of this work was to clarify the morphometric knowledge of these two branches and to discuss the clinical relevance of the anatomical features.Intermediate and lateral branches of supraclavicular nerves of 14 necks (8 embalmed cadavers) were dissected using magnifying glasses. Macroscopic parameters were measured and nerve relationships were recorded.In 12 cases, the intermediate and lateral branches arose from a common trunk behind the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoideus muscle, at a mean distance of 96 mm (70-137) from the sternal angle. The intermediate branch divided into two or three secondary rami. Its most internal ramus crossed the middle third of the clavicle and its most external ramus crossed the second lateral quarter of the bone. The distance between the two farthest nerve endings of this branch was at mean of 98 mm (85-125). The mean distance of the most distal nerve ending from the clavicle was 46 mm (30-63). The lateral branch divided into two or three rami in eight cases and did not divide in six cases. Its most anterior rami crossed the trapezius muscle at a mean distance from the clavicular insertion of 17 mm (12-24). In 13 cases, these rami ended posteriorly or at the level of the anterior border of the acromion process and in 12 cases, they ended laterally or at the level of the acromion process with a mean distance 10.4 mm (0-24).In case of deficiency of these nerves, pain or sensitive deficit can occur without motor trouble. The factors of acute or chronic injury are direct compression, nerve stretching, repetitive stresses, and direct wound. Moreover, several neck or shoulder surgical approaches are dangerous for these nerves.",

          "abstract": "Optimal vibration stimulation to the neck extensor muscles using hydraulic vibrators to shorten the saccadic reaction time was examined. Subjects were 14 healthy young adults. Visual targets (LEDs) were located 10 degrees left and right of a central point. The targets were alternately lit for random durations of 2-4 seconds in a resting neck condition and various vibration conditions, and saccadic reaction times were measured. Vibration amplitude was 0.5 mm in every condition. The upper trapezius muscles were vibrated at 40, 60, 80, and 100 Hz in a sub-maximum stretch condition in which the muscles were stretched at 70% of maximum stretch. In addition, the muscles were vibrated at 60 Hz with the muscles maximally stretched, with 70% vertical pressure without stretching, and with vibration applied to the skin in the same area as the muscle vibration. At 60, 80, and 100 Hz at 70% maximum stretch, saccadic reaction time shortened significantly compared with the resting neck condition. However, no significant difference in the reaction time was observed among the frequencies. The saccadic reaction times in the maximum stretch condition, muscle pressure condition, and skin contact condition did not differ significantly from that in the resting neck condition. Vibration stimulation to the trapezius with 60-100 Hz frequencies at 0.5 mm amplitude in the sub-maximum stretch condition was effective for shortening saccadic reaction time. The main mechanism appears to be Ia information originating from the muscle spindle.",

Tenderness to palpation was elicited from the occiput to T4 bilaterally. Trigger points were palpated in the pectoralis major, levator scapulae, upper trapezius, and supraspinatus muscles bilaterally. Range of motion in the cervical region was decreased in all ranges and was painful. Visual examination demonstrated severe forward translation of the head, rounded shoulders, and right cervical translation.The patient was adjusted using high-velocity, short-lever arm manipulation procedures (diversified technique) and was given interferential myofascial release and cryotherapy 3 times weekly for 2 weeks. He progressed to stretching and isometric exercise, McKenzie retraction exercises, and physioball for proprioception, among other therapies. The patient's initial headache lasted 4 days. He had a second headache for 1.5 days during his exercise training. During the next 7 months while returning to the clinic twice monthly for an elective chiropractic maintenance program, his headaches did not recur. He also had improvement on radiograph.The principles of upper crossed syndrome and the use of exercise, chiropractic care, and myofascial release in the treatment of cervicogenic headache are discussed. A review of the literature indicates that analyzing muscle imbalance as well as vertebral subluxation may increase the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for cervicogenic headache.",

          "abstract": "Injury to the accessory nerve results in an obvious shoulder droop, loss of shoulder elevation, and pain. Prevention of inadvertent injury to the accessory nerve is critical in neck dissection. No previous study, however, anatomically demonstrates the mechanism of the spinal accessory nerve traction injury. Anatomic determination of the location and course of the spinal accessory nerve may be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanism of the nerve injury. The accessory nerve courses obliquely across the posterior triangle on the surface of the levator scapula muscle and reaches the trapezius. The length of the spinal accessory nerve in the posterior triangle is 34.7+/- 6.3 mm. The nerve passes through the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle 50.7+/- 12.9 mm below the tip of the mastoid process and reaches the anterior border of the trapezius 49.8 +/- 5.9 mm above the clavicle. It makes a posterior angle of 73.1 degrees +/- 19.4 degrees, on average, relative to the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid. When the shoulder is pulled down and the head is turned to the opposite direction, the spinal accessory nerve is stretched in the posterior triangle. In the posterior triangle, the nerve is vulnerable, since it is superficial and covered only by skin and subcutaneous fascia. Therefore, extreme caution should be taken with any surgical procedures in the posterior triangle. Traction injury of the spinal accessory nerve in the posterior triangle cannot be ignored.",

          "abstract": "We reviewed the results of repair of the spinal accessory nerve in seven patients seen between September 1994 and January 1996. The nerve had been injured during biopsy of a cervical lymph node in six patients and during removal of a bullet in one. The average interval between the time of the injury and the repair of the nerve was eight months (range, three to fourteen months). An end-to-end repair of the nerve was performed in six patients, and a neurolysis was done in one. The average duration of follow-up was thirty-two months (range, twenty-four to thirty-nine months). Postoperatively, all seven patients had relief of pain and stiffness in the shoulder girdle. Manual muscle-testing revealed normal strength of the trapezius, which was comparable with that on the unaffected side. Four patients regained normal function of the shoulder. Three patients reported a stretching sensation or discomfort in the neck, periscapular discomfort, and fatigue of the extremity when lifting heavy objects or performing overhead activities. However, these residual symptoms were mild and tolerable and thus were different in nature from the preoperative pain and stiffness. Iatrogenic injury of the spinal accessory nerve should be suspected if a patient has pain or stiffness in the shoulder girdle and a history of a recent operation on the neck. The nerve should be explored if spontaneous recovery does not occur.",

          "abstract": "We report the clinical and electrophysiological findings of isolated stretch-induced accessory nerve palsy obtained by using conventional technique compared to magnetic stimulation at the base of the skull. The same methods of magnetic stimulation were applied in 10 healthy volunteers, to determine normal limits of amplitude and latency of the motor responses. The clinical features of the isolated spinal accessory nerve palsy are weakness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and of the three portions of trapezius muscle. Most commonly reported etiologies include surgical manipulation and excision in the posterior triangle of the neck. Less frequently the cause is represented by radiation procedures, shoulder traction, penetrating, blunt or stretch injuries; this last etiology is extremely rare. The use of conventional electrophysiological methods to evaluate injuries of the nerves leaving the base of the skull is limited by the difficulty in obtaining an adequate electrical surface stimulation necessitating the use of needle electrodes. Moreover, conventional electrical stimulation often causes significant discomfort to the patient. The magnetic coli stimulation at the base of the skull is a new alternative painless technique that permits to elicit motor responses, by stimulating deeply situated nerves and, in particular, the accessory nerve, resulting as a useful electrodiagnostic tool.",
