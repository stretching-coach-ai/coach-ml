          "abstract": "Pectoralis Minor (PM) length shortening may contribute to faulty scapular. kinematics and result in shoulder pathology.of the Study: To evaluate if a prone scapular retraction exercise will demonstrate an immediate lengthening of the pectoralis minor (PM) in healthy participants.50 healthy participants were measured to determine the length of their PM. The participants then performed three sets of 10 repetitions of a prone scapular retraction exercise. Next, the participants had their PM length measured again to see if there was an immediate change in PM length.PM length was not found to significantly lengthen immediately after the prone scapular retraction exercise. The mean PM length increased by 0.243 cm after the exercise but this was less than the MDC95 of 0.63 cm so the difference does not represent a real alteration in PM length.The hypothesis was that due to the theory of reciprocal inhibition, the PM would increase in length after the exercise. This study does not support this hypothesis. This study suggests that to improve PM length the PM needs to be subjected to more time at a lengthened position than what was afforded by our exercise.This study demonstrated that three sets of 10 repetitions of a prone scapular retraction exercise did not significantly change the PM length.

          "abstract": "Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60-90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001). Conclusions The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.Copyright: © 2024 Thongchote K et al.",

It is reported in the literature that high-volume stretching improves pectoralis muscles strength under supervised conditions while practical relevance is discussed. Therefore, the study objective was to compare the effects of volume equated, supervised- and self-administered home-based stretching on strength performance.Sixty-three recreational participants were equally assigned to either a supervised static stretching, home-based stretching, or control group. The effects of 15 min pectoralis stretching, 4 days per week for 8 weeks, were assessed on dynamic and isometric bench press strength and force development.While there was a large magnitude maximal strength increase (p < 0.001-0.023, ƞ2 = 0.118-0.351), force development remained unaffected. Dynamic maximal strength in both groups demonstrated large magnitude increases compared to the control group (p < 0.001-0.001, d = 1.227-0.905). No differences between the intervention group for maximal strength (p = 0.518-0.821, d = 0.101-0.322) could be detected.The results could potentially be attributed to stretch-induced tension (mechanical overload) with subsequent anabolic adaptations, and alternative explanatory approaches are discussed.

The patients were randomly assigned to receive trigger point injections into the pectoralis muscles and exercise (n=25; 15 males, 10 females; mean age: 42.8±9.2 years; range, 25 to 57 years) or only perform exercise (n=25; 11 males, 14 females; mean age: 41.8±11.2 years; range, 18 to 60 years). The primary outcome was pain intensity at the first month and three months after the first treatment session, measured using the Visual Analog Scale from 0 to 100. The secondary outcome was the Nottingham Health Profile score.Treatment with stretching exercises and trigger point injection resulted in significant pain reduction compared to stretching exercises alone, and the reduction was persistent at the three-month follow-up (p<0.001). A between-group comparison showed no significant difference in the Nottingham Health Profile (p=0.522). Complications related to the procedure or severe adverse events attributable to treatment were not reported.Trigger point injection combined with stretching exercises is an efficient treatment for noncardiac chest pain related to myofascial pain syndrome compared to exercise treatment alone.Copyright © 2024, Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.",

Therefore, 31 recreationally active participants (intervention group: 18, control group: 13) stretched the pectoralis major for 15min/day for eight weeks, incorporating three different stretching exercises. The maximum strength was tested isometrically and dynamically in the bench press (one-repetition maximum: 1RM) as well as shoulder range of motion (ROM) performing bilateral shoulder rotation with a scaled bar. Using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, the results showed high magnitude Time effects (ƞ² = 0.388-0.582, p < 0.001) and Group*Time interaction (ƞ² = 0.281-0.53, p < 0.001-0.002), with increases of 7.4 ± 5.6% in 1RM and of 9.8 ± 5.0% in ROM test in the intervention group. In the isometric testing, there was a high-magnitude Time effect (ƞ² = 0.271, p = 0.003), however, the Group*Time interaction failed to reach significance (p = 0.75). The results are in line with previous results that showed stretch-mediated maximum strength increases in the lower extremity. Future research should address the underlying physiological mechanisms such as muscle hypertrophy, contraction conditions as well as pointing out the relevance of intensity, training frequency and stretching duration.© Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",

          "abstract": "Compressive pathology in the supraclavicular and infraclavicular fossae is broadly termed \"thoracic outlet syndrome,\" with the large majority being neurogenic in nature. These are challenging conditions for patients and physicians and require robust knowledge of thoracic outlet anatomy and scapulothoracic kinematics to elucidate neurogenic versus vascular disorders. The combination of repetitive overhead activity and scapular dyskinesia leads to contracture of the scalene muscles, subclavius, and pectoralis minor, creating a chronically distalized and protracted scapular posture. This decreases the volume of the scalene triangle, costoclavicular space, and retropectoralis minor space, with resultant compression of the brachial plexus causing neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This pathologic cascade leading to neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is termed pectoralis minor syndrome when primary symptoms localize to the infraclavicular area. Making the correct diagnosis is challenging and requires the combination of complete history, physical examination, advanced imaging, and ultrasound-guided injections. Most patients improve with nonsurgical treatment incorporating pectoralis minor stretching and periscapular and postural retraining. Surgical decompression of the thoracic outlet is reserved for compliant patients who fail nonsurgical management and respond favorably to targeted injections. In addition to prior exclusively open procedures with supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and/or transaxillary approaches, new minimally invasive and targeted endoscopic techniques have been developed over the past decade. They involve the endoscopic release of the pectoralis minor tendon, with additional suprascapular nerve release, brachial plexus neurolysis, and subclavius and interscalene release depending on the preoperative work-up.© 2022 The Authors.",

The exact mechanisms underlying these alterations are unknown; however, muscle stretch reflexes may play a role. This work examined short- (SLR) and long-latency (LLR) shoulder muscle stretch reflexes in breast cancer survivors. Forty-nine patients who had undergone postmastectomy breast reconstruction, 17 who had undergone chemoradiation, and 18 healthy, age-matched controls were enrolled. Muscle activity was recorded from the clavicular and sternocostal regions of the pectoralis major and anterior, middle, and posterior deltoids during vertical ab/adduction or horizontal flex/extension perturbations while participants maintained minimal torques. SLR and LLR were quantified for each muscle. Our major finding was that following postmastectomy breast reconstruction, SLR and LLR are impaired in the clavicular region of the pectoralis major. Individuals who had chemoradiation had impaired stretch reflexes in the clavicular and sternocostal region of the pectoralis major, anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid. These findings indicate that breast cancer treatments alter the regulation of shoulder muscle stretch reflexes and may be associated with surgical or nonsurgical damage to the pectoral fascia, muscle spindles, and/or sensory Ia afferents.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Shoulder muscle stretch reflexes may be impacted following postmastectomy breast reconstruction and chemoradiation. Here, we examined short- and long-latency shoulder muscle stretch reflexes in two experiments following common breast reconstruction procedures and chemoradiation.

          "abstract": "Conflicting theories exist about the underlying cause of chronic subacromial pain in the middle-aged population. We aim to improve our understanding of kinematics and muscle activation in subacromial pain syndrome to provide insight in its pathophysiology.In a cross-sectional comparison of 40 patients with subacromial pain syndrome and 30 asymptomatic controls, three-dimensional shoulder kinematics and electromyography-based co-contraction in 10 shoulder muscles were independently recorded. Glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics were evaluated during abduction and forward flexion. Co-contraction was expressed as an activation ratio, specifying the relative agonistic and antagonistic muscle activity in each muscle.During abduction and forward flexion, the contribution of glenohumeral motion to elevation and glenohumeral external rotation was lower in subacromial pain syndrome (at 1200 abduction: -9°, 95% CI -14°- -3°; and - 8°, 95% CI -13°--3°, respectively), and was compensated by more scapulothoracic motion. The pectoralis major's activation ratio was significantly lower (Z-score: -2.657, P = 0.008) and teres major's activation ratio significantly higher (Z-score: -4.088, P < 0.001) in patients with subacromial pain syndrome compared to the control group.Reduced glenohumeral elevation and external rotation in subacromial pain syndrome coincided with less teres major antagonistic activity during elevation. These biomechanical findings provide a scientific basis for intervention studies directed at stretching exercises to reduce glenohumeral stiffness in the treatment of subacromial pain syndrome, and teres major strengthening to improve humeral head depressor function.Copyright © 2021.

          "abstract": "Increased muscle stiffness of the pectoralis minor (PMi) could deteriorate shoulder function. Stretching is useful for maintaining and improving muscle stiffness in rehabilitation and sport practice. However, the acute and prolonged effect of stretching on the PMi muscle stiffness is unclear due to limited methodology for assessing individual muscle stiffness. Using shear wave elastography, we explored the responses of shear modulus to stretching in the PMi over time. The first experiment (n = 20) aimed to clarify the acute change in the shear modulus during stretching. The shear modulus was measured at intervals of 30 s × 10 sets. The second experiment (n = 16) aimed to observe and compare the prolonged effect of different durations of stretching on the shear modulus. Short and long stretching duration groups underwent 30s × 1 set and 30s × 10 sets, respectively. The assessments of shear modulus were conducted before, immediately after, and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-stretching. In experiment I, the shear modulus decreased immediately after a bout (30 s) of stretching (p < 0.001, change: -2.3 kPa, effect size: r = 0.72) and further decreased after 3 repetitions (i.e., 90 s) of stretching (p = 0.03, change: -1.0 kPa, effect size: r = 0.53). In experiment II, the change in the shear modulus after stretching was greater in the long duration group than in the short duration group (p = 0.013, group mean difference: -2.5 kPa, partial η2 = 0.36). The shear modulus of PMi decreased immediately after stretching, and stretching for a long duration was promising to maintain the decreased shear modulus. The acute and prolonged effects on the PMi shear modulus provide information relevant to minimum and persistent stretching time in rehabilitation and sport practice.© Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.",

          "abstract": "Wave surfing will debut in the next Olympic Games and is increasingly popular as a sport. Chronic shoulder complaints are frequently reported amongst surfers, though literature researching its pathophysiology and prevention is scarce. This article provides an overview of the current literature, proposes a potential pathogenesis and a potential physiotherapeutic prevention program for surf-induced shoulder complaints.A systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for articles regarding kinematic analysis of the surf paddling movement. Data sources were Embase, MEDLINE (PubMed) and Research gate. We included case series and cohort studies that originally studied or described the paddle movement made by wave surfers, studies that reported on kinesiologic analysis with nerve conduction studies and studies on 3D motion analysis of the shoulder while paddling.Eight original articles were included that analysed the shoulder movement in paddling surfers. Muscles that are active during paddling are mainly internal rotators and muscles that are involved in shoulder flexion. Internal rotators are active in propelling the surfer through the water, though external rotator strength is only used while the arm is out of the water.In surfers with shoulder complaints, external rotation range of motion and external rotation strength are impaired. Scapulothoracic dyskinesis may occur and subacromial pain syndrome may coincide. Further research should address potential pectoralis minor shortening, which may lead to aberrant scapular tilt and lateral rotation of the scapula. The surfer's shoulder is characterised by external rotation deficit, as opposed to internal rotation deficit in the thrower's shoulder, and it differs substantially from shoulder complaints in swimmers. Therefore, a specific prevention or rehabilitation protocol for surfers is required. Decreased thoracic extension may thereby alter the risk of scapular dyskinesis and hence increase the risk of impingement around the shoulder joint. A potential physiotherapeutic prevention programme should address all these aspects, with the main goal being to increase external rotator strength and to stretch the internal rotators.There is a high incidence of chronic surf-induced shoulder complaints in surfers. Symptoms may arise due to imbalanced training or scapular dyskinesis, which may subsequently trigger subacromial pain. Physiotherapeutic prevention should include stretching of the internal rotators, external rotator training and optimisation of thoracic extension and scapulothoracic movement.",

However, it remains unknown the effects of an exercise and a less intensive stretching maneuver on muscle stiffness of well-trained men. Herein we (i) analyze the acute effects of heavy bench press exercise on the pectoralis major muscle shear modulus of well-trained men and (ii) assess the effectiveness of a 1-min stretching maneuver applied on this muscle after the exercise using shear wave elastography. Fourteen participants performed three sets of bench press from 8 to 13 repetitions maximum. Immediately after the exercise, their right shoulder was passively stretched for 1 min (stretched side) while their left arm stayed relaxed along the side of the body (control side). Elastographic images were acquired for the pectoralis major mid-region of both sides before the exercise, immediately after the intervention and after 5 min of rest. Our results revealed that both the bench press exercise and the static stretching does not affect the pectoralis major shear modulus of well-trained men. Conversely, the shear modulus significantly decreased at 5 min after intervention with respect to immediately after, for both the stretched (from 5.52 to 4.29 kPa) and the control sides (from 5.87 to 4.56 kPa). Therefore, both resistance training session and 1-min static stretching were not sufficient to significantly change the pectoralis major muscle stiffness of well-trained men.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Few studies have examined the effects of kinesiotaping and stretching exercise on PM length or index. This systematic review and network meta-analysis investigated the effects of stretching exercise and kinesiotaping on PM length and index in adults.This study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Randomised controlled trials including adults with or without symptomatic shoulders were included. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I2 statistics, and publication bias was evaluated by constructing a funnel plot.We extracted data from six randomised controlled trials that included 263 participants (age range: 18-50 years). Compared with usual care, kinesiotaping resulted in greater improvement in PM length (mean difference, 1.15 cm; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-2.10 cm). Compared with usual care and kinesiotaping, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching increased PMI significantly, with a mean difference of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.17-1.63) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.29-1.87) cm, respectively.Compared with no intervention, kinesiotaping is beneficial for lengthening the PM. Intervention with static stretching alone has no effect on PM length. Compared with kinesiotaping alone and no intervention, PNF stretching increases PMI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Determining conservative treatment techniques for maintaining and lengthening this muscle is critical. Although some gross stretching techniques have been proven effective, there are currently no empirical data regarding the effectiveness of self-myofascial release for treating tightness of this muscle.To determine the acute effectiveness of a self-myofascial release with movement technique of the pectoralis minor for improving shoulder motion and posture among asymptomatic individuals.Randomized controlled trial.Orthopedic rehabilitation clinic.A total of 21 physically active, college-aged individuals without shoulder pain volunteered to participate in this study.Glenohumeral internal rotation, external rotation, and flexion range of motion (ROM), pectoralis minor length, and forward scapular posture were measured in all participants. The intervention group received one application of a self-soft-tissue mobilization of the pectoralis minor with movement. The placebo group completed the same motions as the intervention group, but with minimal pressure applied to the xiphoid process. Separate analyses of covariance were used to determine differences between groups (P < .05).Separate analyses of covariance showed that the self-mobilization group had significantly more flexion ROM, pectoralis minor length, and less forward scapular posture posttest than the placebo group. However, the difference in forward scapular posture may not be clinically significant. No differences were found between groups for external or internal rotation ROM.The results of this study indicate that an acute self-myofascial release with movement is effective for improving glenohumeral flexion ROM and pectoralis minor length, and may assist with forward scapular posture. Clinicians should consider this self-mobilization in the prevention and rehabilitation of pathologies associated with shortness of the pectoralis minor.",

However, few researchers have reported on the effects of pectoralis minor stiffness on scapular motion during arm elevation. This study investigated whether an acute decrease of pectoralis minor stiffness after stretching changes the scapular motion during arm elevation.The study allocated 15 dominant and 15 nondominant upper limbs in healthy men as control and interventional limbs, respectively. In the intervention limb group, the shoulder was passively and horizontally abducted at 150° of elevation for 5 minutes to stretch the pectoralis minor muscle. Before and after stretching, an electromagnetic sensor was used to examine 3-dimensional scapular motion during abduction and scaption. Ultrasonic shear wave elastography was used to measure pectoralis minor stiffness before and immediately after stretching and after arm elevation.In the interventional limb, pectoralis minor stiffness decreased by 3.2 kPa immediately after stretching and by 2.5 kPa after arm elevation. The maximal changes in scapular kinematics after stretching were 4.8° of external rotation and 3.3° of posterior tilt in abduction, and 4.5° of external rotation and 3.7° of posterior tilt in scaption.

The TG underwent a stretching protocol of the rib cage muscles, while the CG remained at rest under similar conditions. After a single session, TG increased the tidal volume of the pulmonary rib cage (Vrcp) (p=0.020) and tidal volume of abdominal rib cage (Vrca) (p=0.043) variations and their percentages in relation to the thoracic wall, Vrcp% (p=0.044) and Vrca% (p=0.022). Also, TG decreased the end-expiratory Vrcp (p=0.013) and the end-inspiratory Vrcp (p=0.011) variations. In addition, there was a reduction in respiratory rate (RR) (p=0.011) and minute volume (MV) (p=0.035), as well as an increase in expiratory time (Te) (p=0.026). There was also an immediate reduction in sternocleidomastoid (p=0.043) and upper trapezium (p=0.034) muscle electrical activity. Then, the study supports the use of stretching to improve COPD chest wall mobility with positive effects on chest wall mechanics, on volume distribution and electromyography.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present case is that of a 94-year-old male. He was guided for a specific thoracic correction exercises for 12 weeks. The program included breathing correction, thorax mobility, scapular stability and passive stretching of Pectoralis major and minor, performed thrice a week, 30 min each session, for 12 weeks. Outcome measures included the upper body dysfunction changes by posture analysis software and pectoralis minor muscle length test. The Pre and Post-test of the patient demonstrated significantly greater improvements in hyperkyphosis (forward head posture) and pectoralis minor muscle length. This case study provides a promising exercise intervention that may improve flexed posture in older men with age-related upper body dysfunction.",

Therefore, this study is proposed to assess the effects on pectoralis minor's length and acromial distance after active scapular retraction in scaption at 60° elevation. Sixty right-hand-dominant participants (11 males, 49 females) were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group performed pectoralis minor muscle stretching by active scapular retraction, while the control group were asked to sit in an upright position. The result shows that, the mean lengths of pectoralis minor in the intervention group were significantly increased when compared with those of the control group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.014 respectively). Simultaneously, the reduction in acromial distance of this intervention group was substantially greater than the control group's (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001 respectively).

          "abstract": "Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60-90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001). Conclusions The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.Copyright: © 2024 Thongchote K et al.",

The patients were randomly assigned to receive trigger point injections into the pectoralis muscles and exercise (n=25; 15 males, 10 females; mean age: 42.8±9.2 years; range, 25 to 57 years) or only perform exercise (n=25; 11 males, 14 females; mean age: 41.8±11.2 years; range, 18 to 60 years). The primary outcome was pain intensity at the first month and three months after the first treatment session, measured using the Visual Analog Scale from 0 to 100. The secondary outcome was the Nottingham Health Profile score.Treatment with stretching exercises and trigger point injection resulted in significant pain reduction compared to stretching exercises alone, and the reduction was persistent at the three-month follow-up (p<0.001). A between-group comparison showed no significant difference in the Nottingham Health Profile (p=0.522). Complications related to the procedure or severe adverse events attributable to treatment were not reported.Trigger point injection combined with stretching exercises is an efficient treatment for noncardiac chest pain related to myofascial pain syndrome compared to exercise treatment alone.Copyright © 2024, Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.",

The TG underwent a stretching protocol of the rib cage muscles, while the CG remained at rest under similar conditions. After a single session, TG increased the tidal volume of the pulmonary rib cage (Vrcp) (p=0.020) and tidal volume of abdominal rib cage (Vrca) (p=0.043) variations and their percentages in relation to the thoracic wall, Vrcp% (p=0.044) and Vrca% (p=0.022). Also, TG decreased the end-expiratory Vrcp (p=0.013) and the end-inspiratory Vrcp (p=0.011) variations. In addition, there was a reduction in respiratory rate (RR) (p=0.011) and minute volume (MV) (p=0.035), as well as an increase in expiratory time (Te) (p=0.026). There was also an immediate reduction in sternocleidomastoid (p=0.043) and upper trapezium (p=0.034) muscle electrical activity.

Inclusion criteria consisted of symptomatic shoulder pain, limited range of overhead motion, inability to participate in overhead lifting activities, and examination findings consistent with scapular dysfunction secondary to a tight PM with tenderness to palpation of the PM tendon. All patients underwent a lengthy physical therapy and stretching program (mean, 11.4 months; range, 3-23 months), which was followed by serial examinations for resolution of symptoms and scapular tilt. Of the 46 patients, 6 (13%) were unable to adequately stretch the PM and underwent isolated mini-open PM release. Outcomes were assessed with scapula protraction measurements and pain scales as well as American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), and visual analog scale (VAS) scores.Forty of the 46 patients (87%) resolved the tight PM and scapular-mediated symptoms with a dedicated therapy program (pre- and posttreatment mean outcome scores: 58 and 91 [ASES], 50 and 90 [SANE], 4.9 and 0.8 [VAS]; P < .01 for all), but 6 patients were considered nonresponders (mean score, 48 [ASES], 40 [SANE], 5.9 [VAS]) and elected to have surgical PM release, with improved scores in all domains (mean score, 89 [ASES], 90.4 [SANE], 0.9 [VAS]; P < .01) at final follow-up of 26 months (range, 25-30 months). Additionally, protraction of the scapula improved from 1.2 to 0.3 cm in a mean midline measurement from the chest wall preoperatively to postoperatively ( P < .01), similar to results in nonoperative responders. No surgical complications were reported, and all patients returned to full activities.In most patients, PM tightness can be successfully treated with a nonoperative focused PM stretching program. However, in refractory and pathologically tight PM cases, this series demonstrates predictable return to function with notable improvement in shoulder symptoms after surgical release of the PM. Additional research is necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy of isolated PM treatment.",

Impaired movement patterns and postural changes facilitate the flexor response to protect painful tissue in the injured area. Tone changes between tonic and phasic muscles lead to an imbalance in the rotator cuff (RC) muscles.A randomized controlled pilot study.The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of applying myofascial release (MFR) to the muscles in the cervicothoracic region for the treatment of fascia limitations in patients with postoperative RC tear.A total of 20 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The patients in the control group performed exercises, whereas those in the MFR group performed exercises in addition to MFR. Pain intensity, grip strength, pectoralis minor flexibility, Constant Murley Score (CMS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) score were evaluated. Pain intensity was recorded before and after the MFR sessions.There were no significant differences between the groups regarding pain, grip strength, pectoralis minor flexibility, CMS values, or SF-36 score (p > 0.05). There were significant differences in pain levels measured before and after all MFR sessions. Moreover, a significant decrease is shown between the first and last sessions in the MFR group (p < 0.05).MFR can be useful, especially in postoperative RC patients who have pain in the early period. Significant reductions in pain intensity after MFR can help prepare patients for exercise and reduce pain-related medication use.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Compressive pathology in the supraclavicular and infraclavicular fossae is broadly termed \"thoracic outlet syndrome,\" with the large majority being neurogenic in nature. These are challenging conditions for patients and physicians and require robust knowledge of thoracic outlet anatomy and scapulothoracic kinematics to elucidate neurogenic versus vascular disorders. The combination of repetitive overhead activity and scapular dyskinesia leads to contracture of the scalene muscles, subclavius, and pectoralis minor, creating a chronically distalized and protracted scapular posture. This decreases the volume of the scalene triangle, costoclavicular space, and retropectoralis minor space, with resultant compression of the brachial plexus causing neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This pathologic cascade leading to neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is termed pectoralis minor syndrome when primary symptoms localize to the infraclavicular area. Making the correct diagnosis is challenging and requires the combination of complete history, physical examination, advanced imaging, and ultrasound-guided injections. Most patients improve with nonsurgical treatment incorporating pectoralis minor stretching and periscapular and postural retraining. Surgical decompression of the thoracic outlet is reserved for compliant patients who fail nonsurgical management and respond favorably to targeted injections. In addition to prior exclusively open procedures with supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and/or transaxillary approaches, new minimally invasive and targeted endoscopic techniques have been developed over the past decade. They involve the endoscopic release of the pectoralis minor tendon, with additional suprascapular nerve release, brachial plexus neurolysis, and subclavius and interscalene release depending on the preoperative work-up.© 2022 The Authors.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the short-term effectiveness of the reverse plank exercise on parascapular muscle thickness and forward shoulder angle (FSA) in patients with FSP. Participants were divided into the FSP and non-FSP (NFSP) groups based on the observed angle between the horizontal line of the C7 spinous process and the acromion process. All participants performed a total of five sets of reverse plank exercises at 30 s per set. FSA and muscle thickness of the pectoralis major (PM), serratus anterior (SA), upper trapezius (UT), and lower trapezius (LT) were measured before and after the reverse plank exercise. The muscle thicknesses of the SA and LT, and the FSA, were significantly increased after exercise in the FSP group (p < 0.05). Muscle thickness of the PM and UT significantly decreased after the exercise. In the NFSP group, muscle thickness of the LT was significantly increased, and muscle thickness of the PM and UT were significantly reduced after exercise (p < 0.05). Upon using between-group analysis, there were significant differences between the FSA, SA, UT, and LT groups (p < 0.05). The reverse plank exercise has the short-term benefit of correcting and preventing FSP by increasing SA and LT thickness while decreasing PM and UT thickness. We believe that the reverse plank exercise significantly improved the ability to prevent FSP in FSP-related muscles and was beneficial in achieving optimal postural alignment.",

Determining conservative treatment techniques for maintaining and lengthening this muscle is critical. Although some gross stretching techniques have been proven effective, there are currently no empirical data regarding the effectiveness of self-myofascial release for treating tightness of this muscle.To determine the acute effectiveness of a self-myofascial release with movement technique of the pectoralis minor for improving shoulder motion and posture among asymptomatic individuals.Randomized controlled trial.Orthopedic rehabilitation clinic.A total of 21 physically active, college-aged individuals without shoulder pain volunteered to participate in this study.Glenohumeral internal rotation, external rotation, and flexion range of motion (ROM), pectoralis minor length, and forward scapular posture were measured in all participants. The intervention group received one application of a self-soft-tissue mobilization of the pectoralis minor with movement. The placebo group completed the same motions as the intervention group, but with minimal pressure applied to the xiphoid process. Separate analyses of covariance were used to determine differences between groups (P < .05).Separate analyses of covariance showed that the self-mobilization group had significantly more flexion ROM, pectoralis minor length, and less forward scapular posture posttest than the placebo group. However, the difference in forward scapular posture may not be clinically significant. No differences were found between groups for external or internal rotation ROM.The results of this study indicate that an acute self-myofascial release with movement is effective for improving glenohumeral flexion ROM and pectoralis minor length, and may assist with forward scapular posture. Clinicians should consider this self-mobilization in the prevention and rehabilitation of pathologies associated with shortness of the pectoralis minor.",

An unstable shoe was developed as a walking device to strengthen the lower extremity muscles and reduce joint loading. A large number of studies have reported increased electromyographic (EMG) activity throughout the gait cycle in most of the lower limb muscles, and significant kinematic changes in the lower extremity. However, no studies have investigated the effects of wearing unstable shoes on spine kinematics and trunk muscle activity during gait.To compare trunk muscle activity and lumbar spine range of motion (ROM) during gait using an unstable shoe and a conventional stable control shoe.Cross-sectional study.A Biomechanics laboratory.Forty-eight healthy voluntary participants (24.5±5.6 years and 22.7±6.8 kg/m2).Subjects underwent gait analysis while simultaneously collecting surface EMG data of erector spinae (ES) and rectus abdominis (RA) and lumbar spine sagittal plane ROM while treadmill walking wearing regular shoes and unstable shoes.The results showed that the unstable shoes resulted in significantly higher ES and RA EMG muscle activity levels in all gait phases compared to control shoes (P<0.001). In addition, the unstable shoe condition showed a significantly higher mean (mean difference: 3.1º; 95% CI 2.2º to 4º) and maximum (mean difference: 4.5º; 95% CI 2.6º to 6.5º) lumbar spine extension values (P<0.001).Unstable shoes increase trunk muscle activity (ES, RA) and lumbar lordosis during gait compared to control shoes.Based on these findings, the use of unstable shoes may have potential implications in promoting spine tissue health, particularly in strengthening trunk muscles in healthy population or in low back pain treatment.",

          "abstract": "Morbidity of the shoulder after breast cancer is a well-known phenomenon. MRI studies have shown muscle morbidity in cervical cancer and prostate cancer. In breast cancer clinical observations and patient reports include muscle morbidity in a number of muscles acting at the shoulder. Several of these muscles lie in the field of surgery and radiotherapy. Timed interaction between muscles that stabilise the shoulder and those acting as prime movers is essential to achieve a smooth scapulohumeral rthythm during functional elevation of the arm.CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY: Seventy-four women treated for unilateral carcinoma of the breast were included in the study. All patients filled out the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). EMG activity of four muscles was recorded during scaption on the affected and unaffected side. Muscle cross sectional area and signal intensity was determined from MRI scans. The association between EMG and covariates was determined using multiple linear regression techniques.Three of the 4 muscles on the affected side demonstrated significantly less EMG activity, particularly when lowering the arm. Upper trapezius demonstrated the greatest loss in activity. Decreased activity in both upper trapezius and rhomboid were significantly associated with an increase in SPADI score and increased time since surgery. Pectoralis major and minor were significantly smaller on the affected side.Muscles affected in the long term are the muscles associated with pain and disability yet are not in the direct field of surgery or radiotherapy. Primary muscle shortening and secondary loss of muscle activity may be producing a movement disorder similar to the 'Dropped Shoulder Syndrome'. Exercise programmes should aim not only for range of movement but also for posture correction and education of potential long-term effects.",

          "abstract": "To detect the effect and safety of massage therapy on infants with congenital muscular torticollis.A total of 56 infants with unilateral congenital muscular torticollis were enrolled in this retrospective comparative study. The subjects were divided in two groups, namely, the control group and the massage group. The control group (n = 28) received the treatment of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) stretching, while the massage group (n = 28) received massage therapy combined with SCM stretching. The following parameters were compared: the cervical range of motion (ROM) and functional level (muscle function scale and ratio of muscle function scale scores). Complications, if any, were also recorded.Of the 56 infants, 7 infants (12.5%) underwent surgery with little functional improvement. The total effective rate of conservative treatment was 87.5%. No significance was found in terms of the surgery rate between both groups (14.29 vs. 10.71%, P = 0.693). After treatment, the ROM (including rotation and lateral flexion) and the ratio of muscle function scale scores improved significantly (P < 0.05). In the latest follow-up, the massage group showed a greater improvement in rotation and lateral flexion. However, no significant difference in the muscle function scale score ratio was found (P = 0.126). Importantly, no adverse events related to blood vessels, nerves, and SCM occurred.Providing massage therapy in infants with congenital muscular torticollis is a safe and effective method to improve the cervical range of motion and function. However, this study did not find any decrease in the surgical rate between two groups of patients despite adding such therapy.© 2023 Tang, Li, Xu, Ye, Wang, Wang, Shao, Wang and Xu.",

          "abstract": "Early diagnosis as well as treatment is important in management of congenital muscular torticollis (CMT). The purpose of this study was to find an effective physical therapy modality to improve the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle thickness, the ratio of the SCM muscle thickness on the affected side to that on the non-affected side (A/N ratio), and head rotation in infant under 3 months of age diagnosed with CMT.A single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted. Participants were assigned in one of the 3 study groups through randomization. The treatment was performed 3 times a week for 30 minutes until the head tilt was ≤5 degrees. Group 1 was treated by handling for active or active-assist movement, group 2 was treated with passive stretching, and group 3 was treated with thermotherapy. For general characteristics, a χ2 test and 1-way analysis of variance were used. Intragroup differences were analyzed using a paired t test, and intergroup differences were analyzed using an age-adjusted analysis of covariance.After the intervention, there was no significant difference between groups in terms of SCM thickness on the affected side and A/N ratio (P > .05). Degree of head rotation on the affected side showed significant differences between groups (P < .05), with Group 2 showing significantly better results than group 1 and group 3 (P < .05, both).Passive stretching treatment was more effective than other treatments of this study for improvement in degree of head rotation in CMT infants under 3 months of age.The trial is registered at the Institutional Review Board of Sahmyook University (IRB number, 2-7001793-AB-N-012019103HR) and the Clinical Research Information Service (CRiS; registry number, KCT0004862).Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

          "abstract": "Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent primary headache type world-wide. Chronic TTH (CTTH) of >15 headache-affected days per month for > 3 months can cause considerable pain and disability.This case series aimed to investigate whether massage therapy interventions were more effective when muscles of the anterior neck, jaw, and cranium were included.Four female clients suffering CTTH received six pre-determined massage therapy interventions, 45 minutes each, over three weeks. Case A and B (exclusion cases) received interventions addressing shoulder, posterior neck, and occiput muscles; Case C and D (inclusions cases) received interventions addressing the same areas as well as the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, temporalis, and masseter muscles.Treatment included myofascial trigger point release, neuromuscular therapy, and consideration of central sensitization mechanisms present in CTTH.Headache frequency (primary), intensity, and duration (secondary) were recorded via headache diaries for baseline measures (one week), interventions (three weeks), and a runout period (two weeks). Secondary measures also included a headache disability inventory (HDI) at baseline, intervention conclusion, and final measures. After final measures, clients received stretching education and four weeks later, a follow-up phone conversation to note subjective headache reports.All cases had headache frequency and HDI score reductions, while intensity and duration measures fluctuated. At final measures, exclusion Case A and both inclusion cases (C and D) had headache frequency reductions to below CTTH diagnostic criteria, clinically meaningful (> 16%) HDI score reductions, and subjectively reported continued improvements after study completion. Inclusion cases overall had greater decreases in headache frequency and HDI measures.Comparative results suggest there may be additional benefit in reducing headache frequency and disability with inclusion of anterior neck, jaw, and cranial muscles in treatment strategies of CTTH. However, limited sample size makes it difficult to rule out outliers or individual variables. Further investigation is recommended.Copyright© The Author(s) 2020.

Patients were accepted in a single session of manual therapy involving the cervical spine and thorax. Stretching of scalene, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, rectus abdominis, hip flexor muscles; and mobilization of first rib, cervical and thoracic spine, sacroiliac joints and thorax were applied as manual therapy program. Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck were assessed with visual analog scale. Measurements were performed before and immediately after of a 30-minute session of manual therapy. Pulmonary function testing was performed with a spirometer. Respiratory muscle strength (inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure, respectively) was measured. Respiratory muscle endurance was recorded using sustained threshold loading of 35% maximal inspiratory pressure.There were no significant changes in any pulmonary function parameters or maximal expiratory pressure following manual therapy intervention (p>0.05). However, maximal inspiratory pressure and respiratory muscle endurance improved (p<0.05). Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck reduced after treatment (p<0.05).A 30-minute single manual therapy session improved inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance but not pulmonary function and expiratory muscle strength in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Manual therapy may facilitate functional breathing and support use of primary respiratory muscles more effectively together with rapid pain reduction. The long-term effects of regular manual therapy on respiratory parameters should be investigated after surgical procedures.Copyright © 2019, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.",

The TG underwent a stretching protocol of the rib cage muscles, while the CG remained at rest under similar conditions. After a single session, TG increased the tidal volume of the pulmonary rib cage (Vrcp) (p=0.020) and tidal volume of abdominal rib cage (Vrca) (p=0.043) variations and their percentages in relation to the thoracic wall, Vrcp% (p=0.044) and Vrca% (p=0.022). Also, TG decreased the end-expiratory Vrcp (p=0.013) and the end-inspiratory Vrcp (p=0.011) variations. In addition, there was a reduction in respiratory rate (RR) (p=0.011) and minute volume (MV) (p=0.035), as well as an increase in expiratory time (Te) (p=0.026).

The outcomes including the head tilt, the cervical passive range of motion, and the muscle function of cervical lateral flexors determined by the muscle function scale were assessed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. The sternocleidomastoid muscle growth analyzed by the thickness ratio of sternocleidomastoid muscles was measured using ultrasonography at baseline and 8 weeks after treatment.Except the ratio of muscle function scale scores, the postintervention outcomes were all significantly improved in both groups compared with baseline (P < 0.05). The 100-times stretching group showed greater improvement compared with 50-times stretching group in head tilt and cervical passive range of motion at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment (P < 0.05).Stretching treatment of 2 dosages may effectively improve head tilt, cervical passive range of motion, and sternocleidomastoid muscle growth in infants with congenital muscular torticollis.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine feasibility of a clinical trial to measure the effects of manual therapy on sternocleidomastoid active trigger points (TrPs) in patients with cervicogenic headache (CeH).Twenty patients, 7 males and 13 females (mean ± SD age, 39 ± 13 years), with a clinical diagnosis of CeH and active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group received TrP therapy (manual pressure applied to taut bands and passive stretching), and the other group received simulated TrP therapy (after TrP localization no additional pressure was added, and inclusion of longitudinal stroking but no additional stretching). The primary outcome was headache intensity (numeric pain scale) based on the headaches experienced in the preceding week. Secondary outcomes included neck pain intensity, cervical range of motion (CROM), pressure pain thresholds (PPT) over the upper cervical spine joints and deep cervical flexors motor performance. Outcomes were captured at baseline and 1 week after the treatment.Patients receiving TrP therapy showed greater reduction in headache and neck pain intensity than those receiving the simulation (P 0.84).This study provides preliminary evidence that a trial of this nature is feasible. The preliminary findings show that manual therapy targeted to active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle may be effective for reducing headache and neck pain intensity and increasing motor performance of the deep cervical flexors, PPT, and active CROM in individuals with CeH showing active TrPs in this muscle. Studies including greater sample sizes and examining long-term effects are needed.Copyright © 2013 National University of Health Sciences. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent primary headache type world-wide. Chronic TTH (CTTH) of >15 headache-affected days per month for > 3 months can cause considerable pain and disability.This case series aimed to investigate whether massage therapy interventions were more effective when muscles of the anterior neck, jaw, and cranium were included.Four female clients suffering CTTH received six pre-determined massage therapy interventions, 45 minutes each, over three weeks. Case A and B (exclusion cases) received interventions addressing shoulder, posterior neck, and occiput muscles; Case C and D (inclusions cases) received interventions addressing the same areas as well as the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, temporalis, and masseter muscles.Treatment included myofascial trigger point release, neuromuscular therapy, and consideration of central sensitization mechanisms present in CTTH.Headache frequency (primary), intensity, and duration (secondary) were recorded via headache diaries for baseline measures (one week), interventions (three weeks), and a runout period (two weeks). Secondary measures also included a headache disability inventory (HDI) at baseline, intervention conclusion, and final measures. After final measures, clients received stretching education and four weeks later, a follow-up phone conversation to note subjective headache reports.All cases had headache frequency and HDI score reductions, while intensity and duration measures fluctuated. At final measures, exclusion Case A and both inclusion cases (C and D) had headache frequency reductions to below CTTH diagnostic criteria, clinically meaningful (> 16%) HDI score reductions, and subjectively reported continued improvements after study completion. Inclusion cases overall had greater decreases in headache frequency and HDI measures.Comparative results suggest there may be additional benefit in reducing headache frequency and disability with inclusion of anterior neck, jaw, and cranial muscles in treatment strategies of CTTH. However, limited sample size makes it difficult to rule out outliers or individual variables. Further investigation is recommended.Copyright© The Author(s) 2020.

          "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the acute effects of manual therapy on pain perception and respiratory parameters in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome.The study included 10 patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (1 male, 9 females; mean age 31.3±9.0 years; range, 20 to 43 years). Patients were accepted in a single session of manual therapy involving the cervical spine and thorax. Stretching of scalene, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, rectus abdominis, hip flexor muscles; and mobilization of first rib, cervical and thoracic spine, sacroiliac joints and thorax were applied as manual therapy program. Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck were assessed with visual analog scale. Measurements were performed before and immediately after of a 30-minute session of manual therapy. Pulmonary function testing was performed with a spirometer. Respiratory muscle strength (inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure, respectively) was measured. Respiratory muscle endurance was recorded using sustained threshold loading of 35% maximal inspiratory pressure.There were no significant changes in any pulmonary function parameters or maximal expiratory pressure following manual therapy intervention (p>0.05). However, maximal inspiratory pressure and respiratory muscle endurance improved (p<0.05). Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck reduced after treatment (p<0.05).A 30-minute single manual therapy session improved inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance but not pulmonary function and expiratory muscle strength in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Manual therapy may facilitate functional breathing and support use of primary respiratory muscles more effectively together with rapid pain reduction. The long-term effects of regular manual therapy on respiratory parameters should be investigated after surgical procedures.Copyright © 2019, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine feasibility of a clinical trial to measure the effects of manual therapy on sternocleidomastoid active trigger points (TrPs) in patients with cervicogenic headache (CeH).Twenty patients, 7 males and 13 females (mean ± SD age, 39 ± 13 years), with a clinical diagnosis of CeH and active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group received TrP therapy (manual pressure applied to taut bands and passive stretching), and the other group received simulated TrP therapy (after TrP localization no additional pressure was added, and inclusion of longitudinal stroking but no additional stretching). The primary outcome was headache intensity (numeric pain scale) based on the headaches experienced in the preceding week. Secondary outcomes included neck pain intensity, cervical range of motion (CROM), pressure pain thresholds (PPT) over the upper cervical spine joints and deep cervical flexors motor performance. Outcomes were captured at baseline and 1 week after the treatment.Patients receiving TrP therapy showed greater reduction in headache and neck pain intensity than those receiving the simulation (P 0.84).This study provides preliminary evidence that a trial of this nature is feasible. The preliminary findings show that manual therapy targeted to active TrPs in the sternocleidomastoid muscle may be effective for reducing headache and neck pain intensity and increasing motor performance of the deep cervical flexors, PPT, and active CROM in individuals with CeH showing active TrPs in this muscle. Studies including greater sample sizes and examining long-term effects are needed.Copyright © 2013 National University of Health Sciences. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",

In order to establish a comparison between the eletromyographic results (normalized values) obtained from pre and post-physical therapy program it was used the Wilcoxon non-parametric test for dependent data.It was found a significant decrease (p<0.01) in the electromyographic activity during nasal inspiration in all tested muscles after treatment (11.3-3.6% in the SCM, 22.4-11.7% in the sub-occipitals and 8.9-3.1% in the upper Trapezius). At the end of the treatment, the assessed muscles reached lower activity electromyographic levels during nasal inspiration and they became closer of those in the quiet position.The lower activity after the physical therapy program in these muscles indicates a less effort of the accessory inspiratory muscles, probably due to a better performance of diaphragm muscle with the improvement of the body posture.",

Subject-specific head kinematic data were imposed on the model, and neck musculotendon and fascicle strains and strain rates were computed. Electromyographic data from the sternocleidomastoid and the posterior cervical muscles were compared with strain data to determine which muscles were being eccentrically contracted.SCM experienced lengthening during the retraction phase of head/neck kinematics, whereas the posterior muscles (splenius capitis [SPL], semispinalis capitis [SEMI], and trapezius [TRAP]) lengthened during the rebound phase. Peak SCM fascicle lengthening strains averaged (+/-SD) 4% (+/-3%) for the subvolumes attached to the mastoid process and 7% (+/-5%) for the subvolume attached to the occiput. Posteriorly, peak fascicle strains were 21% (+/-14%) for SPL, 18% (+/-16%) for SEMI, and 5% (+/-4%) for TRAP, with SPL strains significantly greater than calculated in SCM or TRAP. Fascicle strains were, on average, 1.2 to 2.3 times greater than musculotendon strains. SCM and posterior muscle activity occurred during intervals of muscle fascicle lengthening.The cervical muscle strains induced during a rear-end impact exceed the previously-reported injury threshold for a single stretch of active muscle. Further, the larger strains experienced by extensor muscles are consistent with clinical reports of pain primarily in the posterior cervical region following rear-end impacts.",

          "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Posterior neck, trapezius, and interscapular pain, exacerbated by poor posture such as forward head and rounded shoulders, is common. In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of isotonic saline injections at nerve entrapment points (NEPs) within the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and scalenus medius (SM) muscles for alleviating spinal accessory nerve (SAN) and dorsal scapular nerve (DSN) compression in patients suffering from posterior neck, trapezius, and interscapular pain. Methods: In this retrospective study, 68 patients were included, with 34 receiving isotonic saline injections and 34 undergoing Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) as a control. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Percent Pain Intensity Difference (PPID) before and after therapy. The effectiveness of isotonic saline injections targeting NEPs in the SCM and SM muscles in relieving pain associated with SAN and DSN entrapment was assessed. Results: Both treatments significantly reduced VAS and PPID scores, with injection therapy showing a larger treatment effect size (Cohen's d: 3.521 for VAS and 3.521 for PPID) compared to ESWT (Cohen's d: 1.379 for VAS and 1.710 for PPID). The mean clinically important difference observed for VAS was 4.2, exceeding the expected value of 2.6, indicating a substantial improvement in pain and patient quality of life. Conclusions: Isotonic saline injections at the NEPs of SAN and DSN within the SCM and SM muscles might potentially reduce posterior neck, trapezius, and interscapular pain associated with possible nerve entrapment, without causing complications. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger, controlled trials.",

          "abstract": "Computer professionals often develop a forward head posture due to prolonged hours of computer use, leading to neck pain. Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), an advanced technique for treating myofascial trigger points, has become increasingly popular for addressing these musculoskeletal issues.The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of IASTM mobilization on SBAL (superficial back arm line) and SM(specific muscles-upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and sternocleidomastoid) in managing chronic neck pain among computer professionals.The study involved 62 computer professionals, randomly divided into two groups. Group A received IASTM on SBAL and group B received IASTM on SM for neck pain each receiving three sessions weekly for four weeks. Outcome variables like Neck Disability Index (NDI), NPRS(Neck Pain Rating Scale), Craniovertebral angle (CVA), and range of motion (ROM) for flexion, and side flexion (right & left side) were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.Significant improvement in NPRS were observed in both the SBAL and SM groups after 2 weeks of IASTM, wth the SBAL group demonstrating greater improvement. At 4 weeks, IASTM on SBAL showed significantly higher improvements in NPRS, CVA, NDI, and flexion compared to the SM group. The repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of both time and group, along with a significant interaction between time and group for all outcome variables, except for CVA.The study indicates that IASTM on SBAL may offer a more effective treatment for chronic neck pain in computer professionals compared to targeting specific muscles.Copyright © 2024.

          "abstract": "Purpose: Forward head posture is identified as the flexion of the lower cervical spine along with the extension of the upper cervical spine, with an overall increase in the cervical curve. This study aimed to compare the immediate effect of upper-cervical level and cervicothoracic junction level manual therapy on head posture, cervical range of motion and muscle activity of the subjects with forward head posture.Methods: A total 22 subjects with chronic neck pain (numeric pain rating scale >3, forward head posture: cranio-vertebral angle <51°) participated in the study and were randomly allocated into the upper-cervical (n = 11) and cervicothoracic junction (n = 11) groups. Cranio-vertebral angle, cervical range of motion, and electromyography amplitude during performance of the craniocervical flexion test were measured before and immediately after the intervention.Results/findings: There were no significant main effects for the group by time outcome score of craniovertebral angle and electromyography amplitude. However, in the range of motion of the cervical area, the cervicothoracic junction group showed a significant increase in extension and right rotation than the upper-cervical group (p < 0.05). Moreover, in both groups, the electromyography amplitude of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was significantly reduced after intervention. The electromyography amplitude of the anterior scalene muscle in only the cervicothoracic junction group was significantly reduced after intervention (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Cervicothoracic junction manual therapy improved cervical alignment, cervical mobility (extension, rotation), and muscle recruitment ability in subjects with forward head posture. These observations may partially explain the efficacy of this manual therapy in rehabilitation of individuals with mechanical neck disorder (with forward head posture).Implications for rehabilitationForward head posture is identified as the flexion of the lower cervical spine along with the extension of the upper cervical spine, with an overall increase in the cervical curve.Cervicothoracic area manual therapy in subjects with neck pain and forward head posture better improved the muscle recruitment ability than upper cervical area manual therapy during motor tasks.",

With the trunk flexed to the left, the left trapezius generated 39% of its maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) electromyographic activity, while the right trapezius generated 31% of its MVC electromyographic activity. The left splenius (ipsilateral to leftward trunk flexion) generated 24% of its MVC electromyographic activity, with all other muscles generating 15% or less of this measure. With the trunk flexed to the right, the right trapezius generated 38% of its MVC electromyographic activity, while the left trapezius generated 32% of this value.

As chronic static muscle use is thought to be associated with the onset of some neck and shoulder pain syndromes, it is important to understand the impact a postural correction program might have on muscle activation amplitudes in the neck and shoulder regions. Normalized surface electromyographic data were recorded from the levator scapulae, upper trapezius, supraspinatus, posterior deltoid, masseter, rhomboid major, cervical erector spinae, and sternocleidomastoid muscles of the dominant side of each of eighteen healthy subjects. Subjects performed five repetitions of each of four seated typing postures (habitual, corrected, head-forward and slouched) and four standing postures (habitual, corrected, and head-forward and slouched). Repeated-measures analysis of variance models (alpha=0.05) revealed that in sitting postural correction tended to decreased the level of muscle activation required in all muscles studied during seated computer work, however this finding was not statistically significant. Corrected posture in sitting did, however produce a statistically significant reduction in muscle activity compared to forward head posture. Corrected posture in standing required more muscle activity than habitual or forward head posture in the majority of cervicobrachial and jaw muscles, suggesting that a graduated approach to postural correction exercises might be required in order to train the muscles to appropriately withstand the requirements of the task. A surprising finding was that muscle activity levels and postural changes had the largest impact on the masseter muscle, which demonstrated activation levels in the order of 20% maximum voluntary electrical activation.",

          "abstract": "Diastasis rectus abdominis is a condition in which the rectus abdominis muscles separate and move laterally, causing stretching of the linea alba tissue with weakness of the abdominal wall. Although it can lead to hernia of the abdominal viscera, diastasis rectus abdominis is not a hernia in itself. This condition is common among women during pregnancy and the postpartum period and can significantly affect their quality of life and their return to sports activity. Unfortunately, information on the incidence, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of diastasis rectus abdominis are limited.We conducted a pilot prospective observational study on 37 patients who practiced sports at high levels (at least 3 times a week with amateur/competitive competitions) who underwent ultrasound measurements of the distance between the rectus abdominis muscles at the level of the xiphoid process, supraumbilical, umbilical, and subumbilical at time (T0), after 2 months from the rehabilitation protocol (T1), and then after 4 months of rehabilitation protocol (T2) from approximately 3 months after giving birth, and we saw an early return to sport.Our data analysis reveals that there is an initial decrease in diastasis during the first 2 months with 3 weekly physiotherapy activity sessions in all 4 measurements. One session takes place on site with physiotherapists, while the other 2 are carried out at home using the rehabilitation protocol provided by the medical staff. At the 4-month follow-up, the improvement was similar to the previous follow-up.Of the 37 women analyzed, 6 were referred to the surgeon; 2 for hernias and 4 for diastases greater than 4 cm. The remaining women benefited from a conservative approach. Patients undergoing the rehabilitation protocol showed improvements in all 4 measures, as well as their early return to sport.",

This study aimed to compare the subjects with and without Pilates experience to find out the effect of the experience on the core muscle activity and muscle co-contraction, and to examine the relationship between the core muscle activation level and the kinematic data. This study involved 32 subjects, including 16 experienced Pilates practitioners and 16 non-experienced subjects. The knee stretch on the reformer was performed in three different positions: flat back with a neutral pelvis, round back with posteriorly tilted pelvis (RPP), and extended back anteriorly tilted pelvis (EAP). The electromyography of the internal oblique (IO), rectus abdominis (RA), multifidus (MU), and iliocostalis lumborum (IL) muscles were measured, as well as kinematic data from a 3D motion analysis system. Compared to the non-experienced subjects, the experienced subjects activated the IO muscles more than the RA muscles, and the most significant difference was seen in the RPP position (p < 0.05). The experienced patients activated the MU muscles more often than the IL muscles, with the most significant difference observed in the RPP position and the least significant in the EAP position (p < 0.05). All kinematic data and muscle activity (IO, IO/RA ratio, MU/IL ratio) showed significant differences between the experienced and non-experienced subjects (p < 0.05). The subjects presented a moderate correlation between muscle activation and core stability. It was confirmed that the experienced Pilates practitioners activated the abdominal and low back core muscles effectively, and the stability of the pelvis and trunk were better than that of the non-experienced participants. In addition, the better the trunk stability was maintained, the larger and more accurate movement of the mobility segment was observed.",

Patients were accepted in a single session of manual therapy involving the cervical spine and thorax. Stretching of scalene, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, rectus abdominis, hip flexor muscles; and mobilization of first rib, cervical and thoracic spine, sacroiliac joints and thorax were applied as manual therapy program. Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck were assessed with visual analog scale. Measurements were performed before and immediately after of a 30-minute session of manual therapy. Pulmonary function testing was performed with a spirometer. Respiratory muscle strength (inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure, respectively) was measured. Respiratory muscle endurance was recorded using sustained threshold loading of 35% maximal inspiratory pressure.There were no significant changes in any pulmonary function parameters or maximal expiratory pressure following manual therapy intervention (p>0.05). However, maximal inspiratory pressure and respiratory muscle endurance improved (p<0.05). Pain perceptions of upper arm and neck reduced after treatment (p<0.05).A 30-minute single manual therapy session improved inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance but not pulmonary function and expiratory muscle strength in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Manual therapy may facilitate functional breathing and support use of primary respiratory muscles more effectively together with rapid pain reduction. The long-term effects of regular manual therapy on respiratory parameters should be investigated after surgical procedures.Copyright © 2019, Turkish League Against Rheumatism.",

          "abstract": "Various stimuli such as the flexibility of lumbopelvic structures influence the neuromuscular responses of the trunk musculature, leading to different load sharing strategies and reflex muscle responses from the afferents of lumbopelvic mechanoreceptors. This link between flexibility and neuromuscular response has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lumbopelvic flexibility and neuromuscular responses of the erector spinae, hamstring and abdominal muscles during trunk flexion-extension. Lumbopelvic movement patterns were measured in 29 healthy women, who were separated into two groups according to their flexibility during trunk flexion-extension. The electromyographic responses of erector spinae, rectus abdominis and biceps femoris were also recorded. Subjects with greater lumbar flexibility had significantly less pelvic flexibility and vice versa. Subjects with greater pelvic flexibility had a higher rate of relaxation and lower levels of hamstring activation during maximal trunk flexion. The neuromuscular response patterns of the hamstrings seem partially modulated by pelvic flexibility. Not so with the lumbar erector spinae and lumbar flexibility, despite the assertions of some previous studies. The results of this study improve our knowledge of the relationships between trunk joint flexibility and neuromuscular responses, a relationship which may play a role in low back pain.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

          "title": "Rib stress fractures among rowers: definition, epidemiology, mechanisms, risk factors and effectiveness of injury prevention strategies.",
          "abstract": "Rib stress fractures (RSFs) can have serious effects on rowing training and performance and accordingly represent an important topic for sports medicine practitioners. Therefore, the aim of this review is to outline the definition, epidemiology, mechanisms, intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, injury management and injury prevention strategies for RSF in rowers. To this end, nine relevant books, 140 journal articles, the proceedings of five conferences and two unpublished presentations were reviewed after searches of electronic databases using the keywords 'rowing', 'rib', 'stress fracture', 'injury', 'mechanics' and 'kinetics'. The review showed that RSF is an incomplete fracture occurring from an imbalance between the rate of bone resorption and the rate of bone formation. RSF occurs in 8.1-16.4% of elite rowers, 2% of university rowers and 1% of junior elite rowers. Approximately 86% of rowing RSF cases with known locations occur in ribs four to eight, mostly along the anterolateral/lateral rib cage. Elite rowers are more likely to experience RSF than nonelite rowers. Injury occurrence is equal among sweep rowers and scullers, but the regional location of the injury differs. The mechanism of injury is multifactorial with numerous intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors contributing. Posterior-directed resultant forces arising from the forward directed force vector through the arms to the oar handle in combination with the force vector induced by the scapula retractors during mid-drive, or repetitive stress from the external obliques and rectus abdominis in the 'finish' position, may be responsible for RSF. Joint hypomobility, vertebral malalignment or low bone mineral density may be associated with RSF. Case studies have shown increased risk associated with amenorrhoea, low bone density or poor technique, in combination with increases in training volume. Training volume alone may have less effect on injury than other factors. Large differences in seat and handle velocity, sequential movement patterns, higher elbow-flexion to knee-extension strength ratios, higher seat-to-handle velocity during the initial drive, or higher shoulder angle excursion may result in RSF. Gearing may indirectly affect rib loading. Increased risk may be due to low calcium, low vitamin D, eating disorders, low testosterone or use of depot medroxyprogesterone injections. Injury management involves 1-2 weeks cessation of rowing with analgesic modalities followed by a slow return to rowing with low-impact intensity and modified pain-free training. Some evidence shows injury prevention strategies should focus on strengthening the serratus anterior, strengthening leg extensors, stretching the lumbar spine, increasing hip joint flexibility, reducing excessive protraction, training with ergometers on slides or floating-head ergometers, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Future research should focus on the epidemiology of RSF over 4-year Olympic cycles in elite rowers, the aetiology of the condition, and the effectiveness of RSF prevention strategies for injury incidence and performance in rowing.",

          "title": "The effect of posture on respiratory activity of the abdominal muscles.",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of posture on the expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles. Fifteen young adult men participated in the study. Activities of the external oblique abdominis, internal oblique abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles were measured electromyographically in various postures. We used a pressure threshold in order to activate the abdominal muscles as these muscles are silent at rest. A spirometer was used to measure the lung volume in various postures. Subjects were placed in the supine, standing, sitting, and sitting-with-elbow-on-the-knee (SEK) positions. Electromyographic activity and mouth pressure were measured during spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary ventilation under the respiratory load. We observed that the lung volume changed with posture; however, the breathing pattern under respiratory load did not change. During maximal voluntary ventilation, internal oblique abdominis muscle expiratory activity was lower in the SEK position than in any other position, external oblique abdominis muscle inspiratory activity was lower in the supine position than in any other position, and internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher in the standing position than in any other position. During spontaneous breathing, external oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during expiration and inspiration in the SEK position than in any other position. The internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during both inspiration and expiration in the standing position than in any other position. The rectus abdominis muscle activity did not change with changes in posture during both inspiration and expiration. Increase in the external oblique abdominis activity in the SEK position was due to anatomical muscle arrangement that was consistent with the direction of lower rib movement. On the other hand, increase in the internal oblique abdominis activity in the standing position was due to stretching of the abdominal wall by the viscera. We concluded that differences in activity were due to differences in the anatomy of the abdominal muscles and the influence of gravity.",

          "abstract": "Diastasis rectus abdominis is a condition in which the rectus abdominis muscles separate and move laterally, causing stretching of the linea alba tissue with weakness of the abdominal wall. Although it can lead to hernia of the abdominal viscera, diastasis rectus abdominis is not a hernia in itself. This condition is common among women during pregnancy and the postpartum period and can significantly affect their quality of life and their return to sports activity. Unfortunately, information on the incidence, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of diastasis rectus abdominis are limited.We conducted a pilot prospective observational study on 37 patients who practiced sports at high levels (at least 3 times a week with amateur/competitive competitions) who underwent ultrasound measurements of the distance between the rectus abdominis muscles at the level of the xiphoid process, supraumbilical, umbilical, and subumbilical at time (T0), after 2 months from the rehabilitation protocol (T1), and then after 4 months of rehabilitation protocol (T2) from approximately 3 months after giving birth, and we saw an early return to sport.Our data analysis reveals that there is an initial decrease in diastasis during the first 2 months with 3 weekly physiotherapy activity sessions in all 4 measurements. One session takes place on site with physiotherapists, while the other 2 are carried out at home using the rehabilitation protocol provided by the medical staff. At the 4-month follow-up, the improvement was similar to the previous follow-up.Of the 37 women analyzed, 6 were referred to the surgeon; 2 for hernias and 4 for diastases greater than 4 cm.

          "abstract": "Pilates is an effective exercise method for rehabilitating musculoskeletal disorders as its principles are based on the activation of local muscles. This study aimed to compare the subjects with and without Pilates experience to find out the effect of the experience on the core muscle activity and muscle co-contraction, and to examine the relationship between the core muscle activation level and the kinematic data. This study involved 32 subjects, including 16 experienced Pilates practitioners and 16 non-experienced subjects. The knee stretch on the reformer was performed in three different positions: flat back with a neutral pelvis, round back with posteriorly tilted pelvis (RPP), and extended back anteriorly tilted pelvis (EAP). The electromyography of the internal oblique (IO), rectus abdominis (RA), multifidus (MU), and iliocostalis lumborum (IL) muscles were measured, as well as kinematic data from a 3D motion analysis system. Compared to the non-experienced subjects, the experienced subjects activated the IO muscles more than the RA muscles, and the most significant difference was seen in the RPP position (p < 0.05). The experienced patients activated the MU muscles more often than the IL muscles, with the most significant difference observed in the RPP position and the least significant in the EAP position (p < 0.05). All kinematic data and muscle activity (IO, IO/RA ratio, MU/IL ratio) showed significant differences between the experienced and non-experienced subjects (p < 0.05). The subjects presented a moderate correlation between muscle activation and core stability. It was confirmed that the experienced Pilates practitioners activated the abdominal and low back core muscles effectively, and the stability of the pelvis and trunk were better than that of the non-experienced participants. In addition, the better the trunk stability was maintained, the larger and more accurate movement of the mobility segment was observed.",

This study aimed to quantify changes in muscle activation at a walk and trot in horses traveling over eight consecutive ground poles evenly spaced (at 30 inches for walk and 48 inches for trot) in parallel fashion in a straight line, and with hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands applied at 25% stretch. Surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected for the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles in six horses. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was performed for each muscle to test for significant differences in differences in normalized average rectified values and maximum low pass signals. Within subject effects were reported, followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons to evaluate differences between the conditions of with or without ground poles or elastic resistance bands. The use of ground poles at a walk resulted in a significant (p < .05) increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles, with an increase in the average rectified value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles and right longissimus dorsi muscle. The use of ground poles at a trot resulted in a significant increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles. The hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands resulted in a respective 27% and 27.2% increase in the mean average rectified value of the left and right RA muscles; however this only reached statistical significance in the left RA (p < .05). These findings provide support regarding changes in muscle activation when using ground poles to increase core and epaxial muscle engagement. While a significant effect on core muscle activation was identified with the elastic resistance bands at a trot, further research is needed in this area to further characterize their effects on muscle activation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "Various stimuli such as the flexibility of lumbopelvic structures influence the neuromuscular responses of the trunk musculature, leading to different load sharing strategies and reflex muscle responses from the afferents of lumbopelvic mechanoreceptors. This link between flexibility and neuromuscular response has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lumbopelvic flexibility and neuromuscular responses of the erector spinae, hamstring and abdominal muscles during trunk flexion-extension. Lumbopelvic movement patterns were measured in 29 healthy women, who were separated into two groups according to their flexibility during trunk flexion-extension. The electromyographic responses of erector spinae, rectus abdominis and biceps femoris were also recorded. Subjects with greater lumbar flexibility had significantly less pelvic flexibility and vice versa. Subjects with greater pelvic flexibility had a higher rate of relaxation and lower levels of hamstring activation during maximal trunk flexion. The neuromuscular response patterns of the hamstrings seem partially modulated by pelvic flexibility. Not so with the lumbar erector spinae and lumbar flexibility, despite the assertions of some previous studies. The results of this study improve our knowledge of the relationships between trunk joint flexibility and neuromuscular responses, a relationship which may play a role in low back pain.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of posture on the expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles. Fifteen young adult men participated in the study. Activities of the external oblique abdominis, internal oblique abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles were measured electromyographically in various postures. We used a pressure threshold in order to activate the abdominal muscles as these muscles are silent at rest. A spirometer was used to measure the lung volume in various postures. Subjects were placed in the supine, standing, sitting, and sitting-with-elbow-on-the-knee (SEK) positions. Electromyographic activity and mouth pressure were measured during spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary ventilation under the respiratory load. We observed that the lung volume changed with posture; however, the breathing pattern under respiratory load did not change. During maximal voluntary ventilation, internal oblique abdominis muscle expiratory activity was lower in the SEK position than in any other position, external oblique abdominis muscle inspiratory activity was lower in the supine position than in any other position, and internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher in the standing position than in any other position. During spontaneous breathing, external oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during expiration and inspiration in the SEK position than in any other position. The internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during both inspiration and expiration in the standing position than in any other position. The rectus abdominis muscle activity did not change with changes in posture during both inspiration and expiration. Increase in the external oblique abdominis activity in the SEK position was due to anatomical muscle arrangement that was consistent with the direction of lower rib movement. On the other hand, increase in the internal oblique abdominis activity in the standing position was due to stretching of the abdominal wall by the viscera. We concluded that differences in activity were due to differences in the anatomy of the abdominal muscles and the influence of gravity.",

Participants performed three core exercises (hip roll, knee-off, and elephant) under three different Reformer spring conditions (fixed platform, platform connected to springs with moderate resistance, platform connected to springs with low resistance).During the hip roll exercise, mean muscle activity of the rectus abdominis, erector spinae, multifidus, and biceps femoris was significantly increased on the low-resistance spring platform compared to the moderate-resistance platform and fixed platform conditions (p < 0.001).

Before and after intervention, rectus abdominis muscle distance, waist circumference and abdominal circumference were evaluated in the two groups, and rectus abdominis muscle separation, waist circumference and abdominal circumference improvement were analyzed in the two groups.There was no significant difference between the two groups before treatment (P > 0.05), and there was significant difference between the two groups after treatment and before treatment. After treatment, the experimental group was further improved compared with the control group. After treatment, the distance between rectus muscles, abdominal circumference and waist circumference in both groups were decreased compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05). The distance between rectus muscles, abdominal circumference and waist circumference of the experimental group were smaller than those of the control group (P < 0.05).Core stabilization training based on biofeedback can effectively improve the symptoms of patients with postpartum rectus diastasis, help to reduce waist circumference and abdominal circumference, and accelerate the recovery of postpartum body shape.AJCEI Copyright © 2024.",

          "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of high-intensity deep squat training integrated with various blood flow restriction (BFR) modalities on the activation of lower limb and core muscles.A randomized, self-controlled crossover experimental design was employed with 12 participants. The exercise protocol consisted of squat training at 75% of one-repetition maximum (1RM), performed in 3 sets of 8 repetitions with a 2-min inter-set rest period. This was conducted under four distinct BFR conditions: continuous low BFR (T1), intermittent medium BFR (T2), intermittent high BFR (T3), and a non-restricted control (C). Surface electromyography (EMG) was utilized to collect EMG signals from the target muscles during the BFR and squat training sessions. The root mean square (RMS) amplitude standard values were calculated for each squat set to quantify muscle activation levels, with these values expressed as a percentage of the maximum voluntary contraction (%MVC). Rating of Perceived Exertion was evaluated after each squat set, and leg circumference measurements were taken.1) During the first two sets of deep squats, the %MVC of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis in all compression groups was significantly higher than that in the control group (p 0.05). In the first set, Group T3's erector spinae %MVC was significantly higher than the control group's; in the second set, it was significantly higher than both Group T2 and the control group's (p < 0.05). 4) After training, a significant increase in thigh circumference was observed in all groups compared to before training (p < 0.05). 5) For RPE values, Group T2's post-squat values were significantly higher than the control group's after all three sets (p < 0.05). Group T1's RPE values were also significantly higher than the control group's after the third set (p < 0.05). Groups T1, T2, and C all had significantly higher RPE values in the second and third sets compared to the first set (p < 0.05).All BFR modalities significantly enhanced the activation level of the anterior thigh muscles, with the continuous low BFR mode demonstrating a more stable effect. No significant differences were found in the activation level of the rectus abdominis among the groups. However, the intermittent high BFR mode was the most effective in increasing the activation level of the erector spinae muscles. While BFR did not further augment leg circumference changes, it did elevate subjective fatigue levels. The RPE was lowest during squatting under the intermittent high BFR condition.Copyright © 2024 Zhuan, Zhu, Zhou, Lei, Wang and Li.",

Compared to the CG, all exercise groups exhibited positive effects on back strength, sprint performance, 1RM, and core muscle biomechanics. Notably, the PSG showed superior enhancement in external oblique stiffness. However, no significant differences were observed among the exercise groups for rectus abdominis biomechanical properties.Structured resistance training effectively improved maximal strength, functional performance, and core muscle biomechanics. The pyramidal training modality conferred specific benefits for isokinetic muscle functions and external oblique stiffness, suggesting its efficacy in enhancing force production capabilities and core stability.Copyright © 2024 Liu, Yuan, Lu and Gao.",

However, clinical practice guidelines recommend multimodal approaches incorporating exercise and manual therapy (MT), and instead reject the application of kinesiotape (KT) in isolation. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to analyze the effects of 12 weeks of exercises combined with MT or KT on perceived low back pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) and muscle electric activity measured with electromyography (EMG) of the rectus abdominis and multifidus in CLBP (mild disability) and to explore the relationship between the rectus abdominis and multifidus ratios and pain perception after intervention. A blinded, 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out, involving three parallel groups of patients with CLBP. The study was registered at Clinicaltrial.gov and assigned the identification number NCT05544890 (19/09/22). The trial underwent an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome revealed a multimodal treatment program supplemented by additional therapies such as MT and KT, resulting in significant reductions in perceived low back pain. The subjective assessment of individuals with CLBP indicated no discernible distinction between exclusive core stability exercises and control-motor training when combined with MT or KT. Notably, our findings demonstrated positive alterations in both the mean and peak EMG values of the right rectus abdominis in the exercise group, suggesting a beneficial impact on muscle activation. This study focused on assessing the activation levels of the trunk musculature, specifically the rectus abdominis (RA) and multifidus (MF), in individuals with CLBP exhibiting mild disability according to the Oswestry Disability Index. Importantly, improvements in the VAS values were observed independently of changes in muscle electrical activity.© 2024. The Author(s).",

Twenty healthy subjects performed a 5 s isometric hold during five two- and one-leg bridge exercises: (1) on right leg with left knee to chest (1LB-LFlex); (2) on right leg with left knee extended (1LB-LExt); (3) standard two-leg bridge (2LB); (4) two-leg bridge with resistance band around knees (2LB-ABD); and (5) two-leg bridge with ball between knees (2LB-ADD). Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected using a Noraxon Telemyo Direct Transmission System from fourteen muscles: (1) three superficial quadriceps (VM, VL, and RF); (2) three hip abductors (TFL, GMED, and GMAX); (3) medial hamstrings (ST) and lateral hamstrings (BF); (4) hip adductors (ADD); (5) erector spinae (ES); (6) latissimus dorsi (LATS); (7) upper rectus abdominis (RA); and (8) external oblique (EO) and internal oblique (IO). EMG data were normalized by maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs). A paired t-test (p < 0.01) was used to assess differences in normalized mean EMG activities between DF and PF for each exercise. EMG activities were significantly greater in DF than PF for the (a) VM, VL, and RF during 1LB-LFlex; (b) ADD during 1LB-LFlex, 1LB-LExt; (c) EO during 1LB-LFlex; and (d) IO during 1LB-LFex. In contrast, EMG activities were significantly greater in PF than DF for ST and BF during all five bridge exercises.

Twenty-two healthy participants (12 females, 23.5 ± 3.1 years) were recruited. LPHC stability was measured by number of errors committed during a seated trunk control test (STCT). Surface electromyography recorded muscle activity of rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique, internal oblique (IO), erector spinae, and gluteus medius during the STCT and single-leg squat, and was normalized to peak activity during the task. Two-dimensional motion analysis quantified frontal and sagittal plane kinematics of the trunk, hip, and knee. Following exhaustive exercise, STCT performance worsened (number of errors: pre: 5.5 (interquartile range (IQR) = 1.4-9.0), post: 8.0 (IQR = 3.6-11.3), p = 0.026.), RA activity increased during the single-leg squat (pre: 42.1 (IQR = 33.6-48.5)%, post: 61.1 (IQR = 39.4-156.7 %, p =.004), and participants displayed less hip and knee flexion (hip: pre: 72.4 ± 22.1°; post: 66.2 ± 22.5°, p =.049; knee: pre: 72.4 ± 15.4°; post: 67.4 ± 18.2°, p =.005).

The women were randomly divided into three groups: core stabilization exercises (1st group), the combination of exercise and abdominal corset (2nd group) and abdominal corset (3rd group). The treatment session for each group continued for 8 weeks. Outcome measurements were pain evaluation, inter-rectus distance (IRD) measured using ultrasound, trunk flexion strength and endurance, balance with open eyes/closed with a balance board, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).Statistically significant difference was observed in all outcome measures except the balance eyes closed results in the first group (p < 0.05).

This study investigated whether the use of a suspension trainer increases core musculature co-activation during exercises vs. its floor counterpart. Participants were 25 healthy volunteers (16 men, 9 women; age: 27.24 ± 4.02 years). Wireless electromyography electrodes were placed bilaterally at the rectus abdominis (RA), erector spinae (ES), and abdominal obliques (OB). Test order (push-up, bridge, and prone plank) was randomized (exercise and condition) with a 3-min rest period between tests. Co-contraction ratios between muscle groups were estimated by root mean square. Ratios (RA/ES, RA/OB, ES/OB) were analyzed using paired t-tests (P ≤ .05). For all floor exercises, co-contraction of core musculature was significantly higher than suspension trainer. During suspension training, perturbations due to increased agonist activation without similar increases in antagonists may be too intense for untrained or injured individuals.

Thirty healthy subjects who participated in this study underwent ADIM and MACM three times in random order. We measured the abdominal muscle thickness during ADIM and MACM using ultrasonography and compared the changes in the thickness of TrA, IO, EO, and RA muscles using a paired t-test. Significant differences were observed in the thicknesses of all the abdominal muscles between the ADIM and MACM groups (p < 0.05). The MACM immediately increased the thickness of the TrA (p < 0.001, effect size (ES) = 0.931), IO (p = 0.001, ES = 0.761), EO (p = 0.008, ES = 0.415), and RA (p < 0.001, ES = 0.767) muscles.

This study aimed to quantify changes in muscle activation at a walk and trot in horses traveling over eight consecutive ground poles evenly spaced (at 30 inches for walk and 48 inches for trot) in parallel fashion in a straight line, and with hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands applied at 25% stretch. Surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected for the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles in six horses. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was performed for each muscle to test for significant differences in differences in normalized average rectified values and maximum low pass signals. Within subject effects were reported, followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons to evaluate differences between the conditions of with or without ground poles or elastic resistance bands. The use of ground poles at a walk resulted in a significant (p < .05) increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the longissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus muscles, with an increase in the average rectified value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles and right longissimus dorsi muscle. The use of ground poles at a trot resulted in a significant increase in the maximum low pass value bilaterally in the rectus abdominus muscles. The hindquarter and abdominal elastic resistance bands resulted in a respective 27% and 27.2% increase in the mean average rectified value of the left and right RA muscles; however this only reached statistical significance in the left RA (p < .05). These findings provide support regarding changes in muscle activation when using ground poles to increase core and epaxial muscle engagement. While a significant effect on core muscle activation was identified with the elastic resistance bands at a trot, further research is needed in this area to further characterize their effects on muscle activation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Participants were instructed to perform maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and five levels of Sahrmann five-level core stability test guided with a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU). The surface electromyography (EMG) data of each muscle during five levels of Sahrmann five-level core stability test were normalized as a percentage of MVC.Results showed significant differences in the normalized EMGs of RA [ χ 2 (4) = 64.80, p < 0 .001], EO [ χ 2 (4) = 58.11, p < 0 .001], and TrA/IO [ χ 2 (4) = 56.00, p < 0 .001] between the five levels of Sahrmann five-level core stability test.

We developed a kinetic chain stabilization exercise to provide a more sustainable effectiveness in adults with HAM tightness.

          "abstract": "Pilates is an effective exercise method for rehabilitating musculoskeletal disorders as its principles are based on the activation of local muscles. This study aimed to compare the subjects with and without Pilates experience to find out the effect of the experience on the core muscle activity and muscle co-contraction, and to examine the relationship between the core muscle activation level and the kinematic data. This study involved 32 subjects, including 16 experienced Pilates practitioners and 16 non-experienced subjects. The knee stretch on the reformer was performed in three different positions: flat back with a neutral pelvis, round back with posteriorly tilted pelvis (RPP), and extended back anteriorly tilted pelvis (EAP). The electromyography of the internal oblique (IO), rectus abdominis (RA), multifidus (MU), and iliocostalis lumborum (IL) muscles were measured, as well as kinematic data from a 3D motion analysis system. Compared to the non-experienced subjects, the experienced subjects activated the IO muscles more than the RA muscles, and the most significant difference was seen in the RPP position (p < 0.05). The experienced patients activated the MU muscles more often than the IL muscles, with the most significant difference observed in the RPP position and the least significant in the EAP position (p < 0.05). All kinematic data and muscle activity (IO, IO/RA ratio, MU/IL ratio) showed significant differences between the experienced and non-experienced subjects (p < 0.05). The subjects presented a moderate correlation between muscle activation and core stability. It was confirmed that the experienced Pilates practitioners activated the abdominal and low back core muscles effectively, and the stability of the pelvis and trunk were better than that of the non-experienced participants. In addition, the better the trunk stability was maintained, the larger and more accurate movement of the mobility segment was observed.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of posture on the expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles. Fifteen young adult men participated in the study. Activities of the external oblique abdominis, internal oblique abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles were measured electromyographically in various postures. We used a pressure threshold in order to activate the abdominal muscles as these muscles are silent at rest. A spirometer was used to measure the lung volume in various postures. Subjects were placed in the supine, standing, sitting, and sitting-with-elbow-on-the-knee (SEK) positions. Electromyographic activity and mouth pressure were measured during spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary ventilation under the respiratory load. We observed that the lung volume changed with posture; however, the breathing pattern under respiratory load did not change. During maximal voluntary ventilation, internal oblique abdominis muscle expiratory activity was lower in the SEK position than in any other position, external oblique abdominis muscle inspiratory activity was lower in the supine position than in any other position, and internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher in the standing position than in any other position. During spontaneous breathing, external oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during expiration and inspiration in the SEK position than in any other position. The internal oblique abdominis muscle activity was higher during both inspiration and expiration in the standing position than in any other position. The rectus abdominis muscle activity did not change with changes in posture during both inspiration and expiration. Increase in the external oblique abdominis activity in the SEK position was due to anatomical muscle arrangement that was consistent with the direction of lower rib movement. On the other hand, increase in the internal oblique abdominis activity in the standing position was due to stretching of the abdominal wall by the viscera. We concluded that differences in activity were due to differences in the anatomy of the abdominal muscles and the influence of gravity.",

          "abstract": "Abdominal muscle strength decreases and fat ratio in the waist region increases following cesarean section. Kinesio taping (KT) is an easily applicable method and stimulates muscle activation. The aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the effects of KT combined with exercise in women with cesarean section on abdominal recovery compared to the exercise alone.Twenty-four women in between the fourth and sixth postnatal months who had cesarean section were randomly assigned to KT + exercise (n = 12) group or exercise group (n = 12). KT was applied twice a week for 4 weeks on rectus abdominis, oblique abdominal muscles and cesarean incision. All women were instructed to carry out posterior pelvic tilt, core stabilization and abdominal correction exercises. Outcome measures were evaluated with the manual muscle test, sit-up test, abdominal endurance test, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), circumference measurements and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze data. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.The improvement observed in the KT + exercise group was significantly greater compared to the exercise group in terms of the strength of the rectus abdominis muscle, sit-up test, VAS, measurements of the waist circumference and RMDQ (p < 0.05).It appears that the addition of KT to abdominal exercises in the postnatal physiotherapy program provides greater benefit for the abdominal recovery in women with cesarean section. Further studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up are needed to verify these results.",

          "title": "The effects of TECAR therapy on pain, range of motion, strength and subscale of HAGOS questionnaire in athletes with chronic adductor related groin pain: a randomized controlled trial.",
          "abstract": "Groin pain is a common issue among athletes. Adductor-related pain is known as the most common cause of groin pain. Although, non-operative treatments have limited efficacy, Capacitive and Resistive Energy Transfer (TECAR), can be used in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. The objective of the present study is to explore the effect of TECAR therapy on pain, range of motion (ROM), strength, and subscales of the \"Copenhagen Thigh and Groin Assessment Scale\"(HAGOS) questionnaire in athletes suffering from adductor-related groin pain (ARGP).This study was a two arm parallel groups randomized sham-controlled superiority trial. A total of 22 male professional athletes (mean age 21.36 years) were randomly assigned to either the real TECAR therapy (n = 11) or sham TECAR therapy (n = 11) group, using block-balanced randomization. Both groups received stretching exercises. Intervention group received 10 sessions of TECAR therapy while, the control group received sham TECAR therapy. Primary outcome was pain that was measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included ROM, strength, and HAGOS questionnaire subscales. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 5 sessions, after 10 sessions, and one month after treatment. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Analysis of Covariance were used to compare between-group mean differences. P-value was set at 0.05. Effect size Cohen's d was also reported. This study took place from September 2022 to August 2023 at the Rehabilitation Clinic at Iran University of Medical Sciences.A total of 22 male athletes were included (11 in each group), with a mean age of 21.09 years in the TECAR group and 21.63 years in the sham group. TECAR therapy was associated with significant reductions in pain intensity across all evaluation sessions. Specifically, after 5 sessions, there was a large effect size for pain reduction (p = 0.01, Cohen's d = -1.09 [95% CI: -0.195 to -1.987]); after 10 sessions, the effect was even larger (p = 0.001, Cohen's d = -2.153 [95% CI: -1.103 to -3.203]); and at the 1-month follow-up, the pain reduction persisted (p = 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.96 [95% CI: -0.944 to -2.978]). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was a significant improvement in hip adduction ROM at the 1-month follow-up (p = 0.03, Cohen's d = 0.908 [95% CI: 0.03 to 1.78]). However, no statistically significant differences were found for other secondary outcomes, with effect sizes ranging from no effect to intermediate.The results of this study suggest that TECAR therapy may reduce pain and improve hip adduction range of motion in athletes with adductor-related groin pain.This trial was registered at the ( https://www.irct.ir ), (IRCT20220622055250N1) on 18/09/2022.© 2025.

          "abstract": "Although supervised exercise therapy (SET) is a primary treatment for peripheral artery disease (PAD), the current literature is limited regarding the mechanisms contributing to increased walking distances, including how lower extremity muscle function is altered after SET. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SET on lower extremity muscle function during walking in patients with PAD.Twelve patients with PAD participated in a 6-month SET program consisting of three weekly exercise sessions (a total of 72 sessions) and adhered to the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) recommendations. Each session started with a 5 min warm-up of mild walking and static stretching of upper and lower body muscles, followed by 50 min of intermitted exercise on a treadmill, and then finished with 5 min of cool-down activities similar to the warm-up. Each patient walked across a 10 m pathway with reflective markers on their lower limbs twice: before (baseline) and after six months of participation in SET (post-exercise). Marker coordinates and ground reaction forces were recorded and imported to OpenSim software (version 4.0) for gait simulations. Muscle force, muscle power, and metabolic rate were estimated from OpenSim and compared between the baseline and post-exercise.The mean plantar flexor force was not altered after SET. However, individuals' plantar flexor muscles demonstrated improvements in force production (lateral gastrocnemius: 75-80% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.43; medial gastrocnemius: 65-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.71; soleus: 90-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.26). Furthermore, plantar flexor power increased (80-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.39) and this was attributed to increased power in the lateral gastrocnemius (80-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47), medial gastrocnemius (80-90% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.22-0.60), and soleus muscles (85-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.49). Similarly, other muscle groups (knee extensors, knee flexors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip extensors, and hip flexors) also exhibited force and power increases after SET. Additionally, force and power variances were significantly decreased in several muscle groups (plantar flexors, knee extensors, hip abductors, hip external rotators, hip extensors, and hip flexors). Total metabolic rate also increased during the stance period where muscle force and power were elevated after SET (early stance: 5-25%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.82; mid stance: 35-45%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47; late stance: 75-80%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.36).Our results suggest that from a biomechanics perspective, muscle functions during walking are improved in patients with PAD after SET; however, the improvements were generally small and were not reflected by all muscle groups.",

A mixed-effect meta-analysis subgroup analysis was also performed on the moderating variables. A meta-regression was also performed between age and stretch duration. GRADE analysis was used to assess the quality of evidence obtained from this meta-analysis.The meta-analysis revealed a small ROM standard mean difference in favor of an acute bout of stretching compared to non-active control condition (ES = −0.555; Z = −8.939; CI (95%) −0.677 to −0.434; p < 0.001; I2 = 33.32). While there were ROM increases with sit and reach (P = 0.038), hamstrings (P < 0.001), and triceps surae (P = 0.002) tests, there was no change with the hip adductor test (P = 0.403).

          "abstract": "Groin pain syndrome (GPS) is a prevalent issue in soccer. This study assessed the effectiveness of a new preventive protocol on GPS for youth soccer players. The protocol included targeted stretching and strengthening exercises for the adductor and core muscles from preseason to midseason. A questionnaire and two pain provocation tests were used for the evaluation. Mild GPS required positive results in at least two evaluations, while severe GPS was associated with pain incompatible with engagement in any activity confirmed by diagnostic ultrasound. Forty-two elite male athletes (aged 16.9 ± 0.7 years) participated in the study, with half of them assigned to the usual training (control group) and the remaining athletes undergoing the preventive protocol (treatment group) for 24 weeks. GPS rates were 14.3% (three diagnoses: two mild, one severe) in the treatment group and 28.6% (six diagnoses: three mild, three severe) in the control group. Toward the end of the season, three players, one from the treatment group and two from the control group had to stop playing due to severe GPS problems. In addition, one player in the control group stopped midseason. Even though the reduction in the risk of developing GPS was not significant (relative risk of 0.50 ([95%CI 0.14 to 1.74], p = 0.2759), the halved incidence of severe GPS and the increased muscle strength related to the treatment (p = 0.0277) are encouraging data for future studies.",

There is growing evidence supporting the effectiveness of dry needling in abating spasticity.The present case aims to quantify the effects of dry needling on upper limb spastic muscles in a survivor of severe traumatic brain injury in a 27-year-old Iranian man. The treated muscles were biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, opponens pollicis, and adductor pollicis. Outcome measures were evaluated before and 1 hour after the intervention. Our results showed that the patient's upper limb recovery stage and hand function improved one grade according to Brunnstrom recovery stages. Spasticity assessed using the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale in all movements showed one-grade abatement, except in the forearm pronator. Passive resistance force decreased in all movements except in forearm supination. Active range of motion and passive range of motion increased in all movements except in active and passive forearm supination. Hand dexterity improved in both affected and unaffected hands.Results shown that dry needling could be a favorable option for reducing spasticity.© 2022. The Author(s).",

However, the effective flexion angle in stretching for each adductor muscle remains unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hip flexion angle on muscle elongation of hip adductor muscles during stretching. Sixteen healthy men were recruited for this study. Shear elastic modulus, an index of muscle elongation, of the adductor longus (AL), and both the anterior and posterior adductor magnus (anterior AM) were measured using ultrasonic shear wave elastography at rest (supine position) and at 5 stretching positions (maximal hip abduction at 90°, 60°, 30°, 0°, and -15° hip flexion). For the AL, the shear elastic modulus at rest was significantly lower than that in all stretching positions. However, there was no significant difference among stretching positions. For the anterior AM, there was no significant difference between stretching positions and at rest. For the posterior AM, the shear elastic modulus in 90°, 60°, and 30° hip flexion were significantly higher than that at rest. The shear elastic modulus in 90° hip flexion was significantly higher than that in 60° and 30° hip flexion. Our results suggest that the AL is elongated to the same extent by maximal hip abduction regardless of hip flexion angle, the anterior AM is not elongated regardless of the hip flexion angle; the posterior AM is elongated at all angles except at 0° and -15° hip flexion and is most extended at 90° hip flexion.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Balance control has been shown to play a fundamental role both in everyday life and many athletic activities. An important component of balance control is the somatosensory information gained from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. The changes in the muscle-tendon unit stiffness could alter the ability to detect and respond promptly to changes of an unstable environment. One of the procedures affecting muscle stiffness is stretching, and contract-relax PNF stretching (CRS) is considered as one of the safest and most effective techniques. So far, there are no studies on the impact of CRS of hip adductor and abductor muscles on body balance. These muscle groups are responsible for maintaining mediolateral balance which is of particular interest, since it is more affected by ageing and disease and since its deterioration has been associated with an increased risk of falling. In light of the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of contract-relax proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching of hip adductors and abductors on mediolateral dynamic balance.The study involved 45 healthy individuals (age 19-23 years) assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Balance testing was carried out before (Pre) and immediately after CRS in the intervention group or after 5-minute rest in the control group (Post). There were performed three repetitions of the CRS targeting the adductor and abductor muscles of the hip.Statistically significant differences between Pre and Post condition were observed only in the intervention group. The values of all measured variables defining the body's dynamic balance were significantly lower immediately after the applied CRS, which indicates an improved body balance: Global Index (p = 0.0001), total area of sway (p = 0.0001), external area of sway (p = 0.00004), external time (p = 0.0004) and reaction time (p = 0.0003).A single dose of contract-relax proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching of the hip adductor and abductor muscles improved mediolateral dynamic balance.",

          "abstract": "Study Design A pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Background The effectiveness of physical therapy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is unknown. Objectives To determine the feasibility of an RCT investigating the effectiveness of a physical therapy intervention for FAIS. Methods Participants were 17 women and 7 men (mean ± SD age, 37 ± 8 years; body mass index, 25.4 ± 3.4 kg/m2) with FAIS who received physical therapy interventions provided over 12 weeks. The FAIS-specific physical therapy group received personalized progressive strengthening and functional retraining. The control group received standardized stretching exercises. In addition, both groups received manual therapy, progressive physical activity, and education. The primary outcome was feasibility, including integrity of the protocol, recruitment and retention, outcome measures, randomization procedure, and sample-size estimate. Secondary outcomes included hip pain and function (international Hip Outcome Tool-33 [iHOT-33]) and hip muscle strength. Poststudy interviews were conducted to determine potential improvements for future studies. Results Twenty-four (100%) patients with known eligibility agreed to participate. Four patients (17%) were lost to follow-up. All participants and the tester remained blinded, and the control intervention was acceptable to participants. The between-group mean differences in change scores were 16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -9, 38) for the iHOT-33 and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.47) Nm/kg for hip adduction strength, favoring the FAIS-specific physical therapy group. Using an effect size of 0.61, between-group improvements for the iHOT-33 suggest that 144 participants are required for a full-scale RCT. Conclusion A full-scale RCT of physical therapy for FAIS is feasible. A FAIS-specific physical therapy program has the potential for a moderate to large positive effect on hip pain, function, and hip adductor strength. Level of Evidence Therapy, level 2b.

          "abstract": "Therapeutic exercises in osteoarthritis (OA) are therapeutic approach with proven efficacy. However, the different disease forms, the lack of established consensus and system for patient education limit the widespread use of therapeutic exercises in clinical practice. The mechanisms of action of therapeutic exercise in OA include the following components e.g. neuromuscular (improvement of proprioception, muscle strength and joint stability), intra-articular (prevention of cartilage degeneration, antiinflammatory effect, improvement of the quality of the joint fluid), periarticular, general health with reduction of cardiovascular risk and psychological components. The main exercises, which are used in OA patients, are stretching exercises, range of motion exercises, analytic exercises for muscle strengthening (isometric and isotonic) and aerobic exercises (walking, cycling, swimming, etc.). The recommended exercise programmes have to be individualized according to patient age, severity of OA and presence of concomitant diseases. The analytic exercises for improvement of muscle strength in hip OA aim to influence the abductors, adductors, flexors and extensors of the hip joint. In knee OA, the target muscle groups are thigh muscles (quadriceps muscle and posterior group of thigh muscles), calf muscles (triceps surae muscle) as well as muscles around the hip joint. There are no established programmes for therapeutic exercises regarding the intensity, frequency, the degree and the interval for increasing of joint load. No significant difference in the efficacy of group vs. individual exercise programmes has been observed. In OARSI recommendations (2010), it is underlined that aerobic exercises and those for muscle strength have a moderate efficacy in knee OA for pain relief e.g. ES (effect size) - 0.52 (for aerobic exercises) and 0.32 (for strengthening exercises). The ES for functional improvement is 0.46 for the aerobic exercises and 0.32 for the strengthening exercises. The data for the role of therapeutic exercises in hip OA are scarce. An effect on pain has been observed (ES-0.38) but without improvement of functional capacity. Therapeutic exercises have low to moderate complex efficacy in patients with OA. They should be an obligatory part in the therapeutic regimens of the patients, which requires close collaboration between rheumatologists, general practitioners and physiotherapists as well as establishment of system for patient education.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.",

Adductor dysfunction is the most common cause of groin pain in athletes, with the adductor longus being the tendon most commonly involved. The most reproducible finding for adductor longus tendinopathy is tenderness along the tendon with passive abduction and resisted hip adduction in extension. Magnetic resonance imaging and injection of a corticosteroid and anesthetic into the proximal muscle-tendon junction are both helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Nonoperative treatment may consist of protected weight bearing, ice application, ultrasonography, electrical stimulation, and gentle stretching with progressive strengthening. However, nonoperative management is not always successful. In these instances, surgical treatment can be quite effective. We present the indications, surgical technique, and rehabilitation protocol of adductor tenotomy for chronic tendinopathy.

The range of motion and muscle hardness of the quadriceps were measured before and immediately after all interventions using a goniometer and a portable muscle hardness meter. The number of repetitions to exhaustion and total amount of volume load (load × repetitions) of the leg extension exercise were assessed. Repeated two-way ANOVA and a Friedman test were used to analyze the variables.Range of motion and muscle hardness were increased after all interventions (both p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of repetitions to exhaustion (p = 0.651) or total amount of volume load (p = 0.206) between interventions.These results indicated that static stretching and walking during inter-set rest intervals did not influence the change in flexibility and muscle fatigue of the leg extension exercise.© 2025 Takeuchi, Inoue, Fujiwara, Shimizu, Nagai, Mizuno and Nakamura.",

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities.

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

          "abstract": "Knee extension contracture is a common postinjury and postsurgical complication, which decreases knee joint flexion. Many techniques have been described in the literature to restore knee flexion, with the most common one being an arthroscopic lysis of adhesions. However, in severe cases, additional intra- and extra-articular procedures are needed to restore full knee flexion. Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) is one of them. Unfortunately, it may lead to devastating complications, such as iatrogenic rupture of the patellar tendon or fractures of the patella or tibial tuberosity. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to present a safer modification of MUA for knee extension contracture in cases in which excessive force is demanded to achieve flexion. The key aim of the \"patellar base support\" technique (PBS technique) is to stretch the contracted quadriceps muscle with controlled and decreased tension on the patella, patellar tendon, and tibial tuberosity.© 2023 The Authors.",

While stretching and massage techniques have been reported to be effective in alleviating APT, it remains unclear if similar improvements can be elicited by posterior chain and core strength training. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an 8-week posterior and core strengthening program on APT, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio, and vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.Ten healthy males (age = 26±12 years; mass = 87±14 kg; height = 1.8±0.1 m) and nine healthy females (age = 22±4 years; mass = 70±14 kg; heigh t = 1.7±0.1 m) performed resistance training (2×/week; 40-45 mins) involving a combination of hip extensors and abdominal strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals. Our findings have potential implications for clinicians prescribing resistance training exercises to improve pelvic posture in healthy asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing chronic low back pain and lumbar-spinal pathologies due to excessive anterior pelvic tilt.",

          "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common public health problem and a leading cause of long-term pain, decreased muscle strength, and even disability. Tai Chi has been proved effective and highly recommended for KOA management worldwide. However, little is known about its benefits on quadriceps strength which is closely associated with relieving knee pain. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tai Chi on knee pain and muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults with KOA.A total of 100 participants will be randomly divided into a Tai Chi group (TC group) (1x/week for 12 weeks) and a control group with a health education and stretching program (1x/week for 12 weeks) with a follow-up period of 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscale at week 12 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include WOMAC stiffness and function subscales, data from isokinetic dynamometry, gait analysis with electromyography (EMG), and a 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). The daily dose of pain-relieving medication will also be recorded. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).We expect this randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi on relieving pain and increasing quadriceps strength in KOA patients. This protocol, if proven effective, will contribute to providing a promising alternative intervention for middle-aged and older adults with KOA.This trial has been registered in the China Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2300069339).© 2023.

We hypothesized that a prevention program could decrease the incidence of LBP in high school volleyball players. This study was an in-season cluster-randomized controlled trial.We block-randomized 8 high school volleyball teams comprising 70 players aged 15 to 17 years into the intervention (4 teams, 34 players) and control (4 teams, 36 players) groups. The intervention program consisted of 9 physical function tests as well as 1 or 2 self-selected preventive exercises, including dynamic thoracic mobility, trunk stabilization exercises, and static stretching, performed during warm-up. Both groups were followed up for 4 weeks, during which the incidence of LBP was recorded. Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99).

Static stretching (SS) has been used to increase the flexibility of muscles and reduce muscle stiffness, but the effects of SS on the stiffness of specific regions of the knee extensor mechanism are unclear. The quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon are essential components of the knee extensor mechanism and play an important role in knee motion. Therefore, we explored the acute and prolonged effects of SS on the stiffness of the quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon and knee flexion range of motion (ROM). Thirty healthy male subjects participated in the study. Three 60-s SS with 30-s intervals were conducted in right knee flexion with 30° hip extension. We measured the ROM and stiffness of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF) and the proximal-(PPT), middle-(MPT), and distal-(DPT) region stiffness of the patellar tendon before and immediately after SS intervention, or 5 and 10 min after SS. The stiffness of the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon were measured using MyotonPRO, and the knee flexion ROM was evaluated using a medical goniometer. Our outcomes showed that the ROM was increased after SS intervention in all-time conditions (p < 0.01). Additionally, the results showed that the stiffness of RF (p < 0.01) and PPT (p = 0.03) were decreased immediately after SS intervention. These results suggested that SS intervention could be useful to increase knee flexion ROM and temporarily reduce the stiffness of specific regions of the knee extensor mechanism.Copyright © 2022 Zhu, Feng, Huang, Li, Wang, Wang, Cao and Zhang.",

          "abstract": "To investigate the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) combined with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on postural stability, muscle strength and pain in patients with tibial plateau fracture.A 3-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 60 patients with tibial plateau fracture. Participants received one of the following interventions: standard treatment (ST group, n = 20), ST + PNF training (ST + PNF group, n = 20), ST + PNF training + TEAS intervention (ST + PNF + TEAS group, n = 20). All treatments lasted for six weeks. Participants' postural stability, muscle strength and pain were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.After 3 weeks of intervention, Between-group comparisons showed that both the ST + PNF group and ST + PNF + TEAS group showed significantly greater performance than the ST group in the postural stability measure (P < 0.02) and pain score(P < 0.05). The peak torque of quadriceps extensors and flexors at the velocity of 60°/s was significantly higher in the ST + PNF + TEAS group than in the ST group (P < 0.02). After 6 weeks of intervention, only the ST + PNF + TEAS group was superior to the ST group in postural stability measure(P < 0.04) and in pain score (P < 0.05). The ST + PNF + TEAS group was significantly higher than the ST + PNF group and the ST group in the peak torque of quadriceps extensors at the velocity of 60°/s and 180°/s (P < 0.01).PNF training could improve dynamic postural stability and relieve pain at three weeks, while TEAS combined with PNF was more effective in relieving pain, strengthening muscle strength and improving dynamic postural stability at six weeks post-intervention.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities.

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

          "abstract": "Poor pelvic posture demonstrated through anterior pelvic tilt (APT) have been known to produce musculoskeletal imbalances involving weakness of the abdominal and pelvic musculature. While stretching and massage techniques have been reported to be effective in alleviating APT, it remains unclear if similar improvements can be elicited by posterior chain and core strength training. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an 8-week posterior and core strengthening program on APT, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio, and vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.Ten healthy males (age = 26±12 years; mass = 87±14 kg; height = 1.8±0.1 m) and nine healthy females (age = 22±4 years; mass = 70±14 kg; heigh t = 1.7±0.1 m) performed resistance training (2×/week; 40-45 mins) involving a combination of hip extensors and abdominal strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals. Our findings have potential implications for clinicians prescribing resistance training exercises to improve pelvic posture in healthy asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing chronic low back pain and lumbar-spinal pathologies due to excessive anterior pelvic tilt.",

Forty-five healthy female soccer players were randomly divided into a regular stretching group, a regular stretching group with soleus stretching, and a control group. Dynamic stretching protocols were performed for 4 weeks during three sessions per week as part of routine exercises. The regular group stretched three muscle groups (i.e., gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and hamstrings), while the regular + soleus group also stretched the soleus muscle. Before and after the stretching intervention, the ankle range of motion test, Y-balance test, drop jump test, dynamic knee valgus test, and Illinois Agility Running Test were performed. Ankle ROM, Y-balance, and DJ significantly improved in both intervention groups compared to controls. Only the regular + soleus group showed improvement in the Illinois Agility Running Test.

          "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common public health problem and a leading cause of long-term pain, decreased muscle strength, and even disability. Tai Chi has been proved effective and highly recommended for KOA management worldwide. However, little is known about its benefits on quadriceps strength which is closely associated with relieving knee pain. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tai Chi on knee pain and muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults with KOA.A total of 100 participants will be randomly divided into a Tai Chi group (TC group) (1x/week for 12 weeks) and a control group with a health education and stretching program (1x/week for 12 weeks) with a follow-up period of 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscale at week 12 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include WOMAC stiffness and function subscales, data from isokinetic dynamometry, gait analysis with electromyography (EMG), and a 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). The daily dose of pain-relieving medication will also be recorded. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).We expect this randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi on relieving pain and increasing quadriceps strength in KOA patients. This protocol, if proven effective, will contribute to providing a promising alternative intervention for middle-aged and older adults with KOA.This trial has been registered in the China Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2300069339).© 2023.

The first aim of this study was to investigate the association between the stiffness of the patellar and quadriceps tendon (PT, QT), gastrocnemius-Achilles tendon unit (GAT), and rectus femoris (RF) using drop jump (DJ) performance in young basketball players. The second aim was to investigate possible variations in the stiffness levels of those tissues in different developmental stages.The stiffness levels of the GAT, PT, QT, and RF were measured in both limbs in 73 male basketball players aged 12 to 18 years. The reactive strength index (RSI), contact time (CT) and jump height (JH) during 30 and 40 cm DJs were also measured.Pearson correlation coefficients showed a significant association between DJ performance and PT, QT, GAT, and RF dynamic stiffness. Moreover, the youngest subjects were found to have lower stiffness values than the older ones.Tissue stiffness can affect athletic performance by modifying the stretch-shortening cycle in young basketball players. Stiffness of muscles and tendons increases during the maturation process. Further investigations could shed light on the effect of training on the stiffness of muscles and tendons.",

We hypothesized that a prevention program could decrease the incidence of LBP in high school volleyball players. This study was an in-season cluster-randomized controlled trial.We block-randomized 8 high school volleyball teams comprising 70 players aged 15 to 17 years into the intervention (4 teams, 34 players) and control (4 teams, 36 players) groups. The intervention program consisted of 9 physical function tests as well as 1 or 2 self-selected preventive exercises, including dynamic thoracic mobility, trunk stabilization exercises, and static stretching, performed during warm-up. Both groups were followed up for 4 weeks, during which the incidence of LBP was recorded. Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99).

Participants received one of the following interventions: standard treatment (ST group, n = 20), ST + PNF training (ST + PNF group, n = 20), ST + PNF training + TEAS intervention (ST + PNF + TEAS group, n = 20). All treatments lasted for six weeks. Participants' postural stability, muscle strength and pain were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.After 3 weeks of intervention, Between-group comparisons showed that both the ST + PNF group and ST + PNF + TEAS group showed significantly greater performance than the ST group in the postural stability measure (P < 0.02) and pain score(P < 0.05). The peak torque of quadriceps extensors and flexors at the velocity of 60°/s was significantly higher in the ST + PNF + TEAS group than in the ST group (P < 0.02). After 6 weeks of intervention, only the ST + PNF + TEAS group was superior to the ST group in postural stability measure(P < 0.04) and in pain score (P < 0.05). The ST + PNF + TEAS group was significantly higher than the ST + PNF group and the ST group in the peak torque of quadriceps extensors at the velocity of 60°/s and 180°/s (P < 0.01).PNF training could improve dynamic postural stability and relieve pain at three weeks, while TEAS combined with PNF was more effective in relieving pain, strengthening muscle strength and improving dynamic postural stability at six weeks post-intervention.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Muscle forces were estimated in OpenSim when hamstring optimal lengths changed in the range of 70-130% of the control case in 5% increments. The force and accumulated force of quadriceps muscle were calculated to evaluate the impact of hamstring optimal lengths on the loading on tibial tuberosity. The changes in muscle forces throughout the gait cycle were compared by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The average peak force and accumulated force of five gait cycles were compared.Although the maximum force of the quadriceps muscle was slightly affected by changes in hamstring optimal lengths, the accumulated force of quadriceps muscle increased by 21.97% with hamstring optimal lengths decreased by 30% of the control case. The increase of the muscle force mainly occurred in the early stance phase and terminal swing phase (P < 0.05). However, when hamstring optimal lengths were longer than the control, it had a little effect on accumulated force of quadriceps muscle.The results of this study indicate that a shorter hamstring optimal length, which means lack of flexibility, can cause a high accumulated force on tibial tuberosity, thus increasing the risk of OSD. Hamstring stretching exercise is only effective for people with lack of hamstring flexibility.Copyright © 2022 Xueying Zhang et al.",

Jump performance was assessed with a force plate, and tissue stiffness was assessed with a MyotonPro device. While no changes were detected in the countermovement jump performance, the PNF + PSA interventions resulted in a decrease in drop jump performance which led to a large magnitude of change following the triceps surae PNF + PSA and a small-to-medium magnitude of change following the quadriceps PNF + PSA. Moreover, in the triceps surae PNF + PSA intervention, a decrease in Achilles tendon stiffness was seen, while in the quadriceps PNF + PSA intervention, a decrease in the overall quadriceps muscle stiffness was seen.

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigated the effects of flywheel squat training on lower body muscle function adaptations and sport-specific performance in collegiate club water polo players. Methods: Thirteen collegiate club water polo athletes (5 women, 8 men) performed flywheel squat training for 4 weeks. Isokinetic knee extension (KE) peak power (PP) and peak torque (PT), flywheel squat peak power (FPP) and mean power (FMP), countermovement jump (CMJ), in-water jump height (WJH) and foot speed were assessed at baseline (Pre1), 4 weeks (Pre2), and 8 weeks (Post) with the first 4 week block being a control period and the second 4 week block being the experimental training. Throughout the training period muscle soreness was assessed using a VAS scale, and FPP and FMP were assessed during every other session. Results: Isokinetic KE PP and PT increased from Pre1 to Post, and FPP and FMP increased between Pre1 and Post, and Pre2 and Post. CMJ and foot speed were unchanged. WJH displayed a change between Pre1 and Post. FPP increased 19% from session 2 to 4 and FMP increased 27% from session 2 to 6, and each remained elevated through session 8. Conclusion: 4 weeks of flywheel squat training in collegiate club water polo players elicited large gains (47-52%) in flywheel-specific squat power, but did not influence sport-specific performance measures including CMJ, WJH, and foot speed. Water-based exercises and stretch-shortening cycle movements (plyometrics) in combination with effective resistance training programs, which may include flywheel-based training, are likely needed for marked sport skill improvements.",

Static stretching and walking may increase muscle blood flow and promote recovery during inter-set rest intervals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 20 seconds of static stretching and walking during inter-set rest intervals of leg extension exercises on the number of repetitions to exhaustion, total amount of volume, and flexibility of the quadriceps (joint range of motion and muscle hardness) in untrained healthy males.Fourteen healthy, untrained men performed three different interventions (passive rest, static stretching, and walking) during inter-set rest intervals of a leg extension exercise with a 70% load of maximum muscle strength, in random order. The range of motion and muscle hardness of the quadriceps were measured before and immediately after all interventions using a goniometer and a portable muscle hardness meter. The number of repetitions to exhaustion and total amount of volume load (load × repetitions) of the leg extension exercise were assessed. Repeated two-way ANOVA and a Friedman test were used to analyze the variables.Range of motion and muscle hardness were increased after all interventions (both p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of repetitions to exhaustion (p = 0.651) or total amount of volume load (p = 0.206) between interventions.These results indicated that static stretching and walking during inter-set rest intervals did not influence the change in flexibility and muscle fatigue of the leg extension exercise.© 2025 Takeuchi, Inoue, Fujiwara, Shimizu, Nagai, Mizuno and Nakamura.",

J Strength Cond Res 39(2): 173-183, 2025-Exercise warm-up may include static or dynamic stretching, impacting performance differently. This study investigated the effects of various stretching protocols on isokinetic strength, muscular activity, and vertical jump performance. Sixteen subjects, divided evenly between trained and untrained groups, underwent 8 distinct stretching conditions in random order. Outcomes measured included isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque and power, muscular activity (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and biceps femoris), and jump performance (jump height and modified reactive strength index [RSImod]). Responses to the stretching conditions were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach. For isokinetic knee extension, dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist (DY-AG-ANT) and combined dynamic agonist with static antagonist stretching (DY-AG ST-ANT) produced significant improvements. Dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist increased peak torque by 12.72% and average torque by 30.80%, while DY-AG ST-ANT increased peak torque by 15.61% and average torque by 41.06%. Muscular activity also improved significantly; DY-AG ST-ANT increased EMG activity of the vastus lateralis by 29.43% and vastus medialis by 70.75%. Biceps femoris saw a 33.18% increase with DY-AG and a 22.15% increase with ST-AG. Countermovement jump height improved with DY-AG-ANT (12.6%) and static antagonist (ST-ANT) conditions (11.3%) ( p < 0.05). Dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist also enhanced average power knee extension by 32.41%, while ST-AG DY-ANT improved it by 31.09% ( p < 0.05).

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

          "abstract": "Abnormal adherence at functional myofascial interfaces is hypothesized as an important phenomenon in myofascial pain syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities.

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

          "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common public health problem and a leading cause of long-term pain, decreased muscle strength, and even disability. Tai Chi has been proved effective and highly recommended for KOA management worldwide. However, little is known about its benefits on quadriceps strength which is closely associated with relieving knee pain. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tai Chi on knee pain and muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults with KOA.A total of 100 participants will be randomly divided into a Tai Chi group (TC group) (1x/week for 12 weeks) and a control group with a health education and stretching program (1x/week for 12 weeks) with a follow-up period of 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscale at week 12 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include WOMAC stiffness and function subscales, data from isokinetic dynamometry, gait analysis with electromyography (EMG), and a 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). The daily dose of pain-relieving medication will also be recorded. All adverse effects will be assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).We expect this randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi on relieving pain and increasing quadriceps strength in KOA patients. This protocol, if proven effective, will contribute to providing a promising alternative intervention for middle-aged and older adults with KOA.This trial has been registered in the China Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2300069339).© 2023.

          "abstract": "The relationship between stiffness and drop jump performance in athletes in various stages of development has yet to be fully investigated. The first aim of this study was to investigate the association between the stiffness of the patellar and quadriceps tendon (PT, QT), gastrocnemius-Achilles tendon unit (GAT), and rectus femoris (RF) using drop jump (DJ) performance in young basketball players. The second aim was to investigate possible variations in the stiffness levels of those tissues in different developmental stages.The stiffness levels of the GAT, PT, QT, and RF were measured in both limbs in 73 male basketball players aged 12 to 18 years. The reactive strength index (RSI), contact time (CT) and jump height (JH) during 30 and 40 cm DJs were also measured.Pearson correlation coefficients showed a significant association between DJ performance and PT, QT, GAT, and RF dynamic stiffness. Moreover, the youngest subjects were found to have lower stiffness values than the older ones.Tissue stiffness can affect athletic performance by modifying the stretch-shortening cycle in young basketball players. Stiffness of muscles and tendons increases during the maturation process. Further investigations could shed light on the effect of training on the stiffness of muscles and tendons.",

          "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is a common injury in high school volleyball players. We hypothesized that a prevention program could decrease the incidence of LBP in high school volleyball players. This study was an in-season cluster-randomized controlled trial.We block-randomized 8 high school volleyball teams comprising 70 players aged 15 to 17 years into the intervention (4 teams, 34 players) and control (4 teams, 36 players) groups. The intervention program consisted of 9 physical function tests as well as 1 or 2 self-selected preventive exercises, including dynamic thoracic mobility, trunk stabilization exercises, and static stretching, performed during warm-up. Both groups were followed up for 4 weeks, during which the incidence of LBP was recorded. Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99). Lumbar extension accounted for nearly 70% of LBP incidences. Most players in the intervention group demonstrated improved physical function associated with the exercises.The semi-customized prevention program decreased the incidence of LBP and enhanced the physical function parameter in high school volleyball players.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

          "abstract": "To investigate the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) combined with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on postural stability, muscle strength and pain in patients with tibial plateau fracture.A 3-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 60 patients with tibial plateau fracture. Participants received one of the following interventions: standard treatment (ST group, n = 20), ST + PNF training (ST + PNF group, n = 20), ST + PNF training + TEAS intervention (ST + PNF + TEAS group, n = 20). All treatments lasted for six weeks. Participants' postural stability, muscle strength and pain were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.After 3 weeks of intervention, Between-group comparisons showed that both the ST + PNF group and ST + PNF + TEAS group showed significantly greater performance than the ST group in the postural stability measure (P < 0.02) and pain score(P < 0.05). The peak torque of quadriceps extensors and flexors at the velocity of 60°/s was significantly higher in the ST + PNF + TEAS group than in the ST group (P < 0.02). After 6 weeks of intervention, only the ST + PNF + TEAS group was superior to the ST group in postural stability measure(P < 0.04) and in pain score (P < 0.05). The ST + PNF + TEAS group was significantly higher than the ST + PNF group and the ST group in the peak torque of quadriceps extensors at the velocity of 60°/s and 180°/s (P < 0.01).PNF training could improve dynamic postural stability and relieve pain at three weeks, while TEAS combined with PNF was more effective in relieving pain, strengthening muscle strength and improving dynamic postural stability at six weeks post-intervention.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Clarifying the muscular factors that contribute to performance improvement can be beneficial for athletes and coaches. The present study examined the relationships between the resting muscle shear modulus and dynamic performance during the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) and explosive exercises. To this end, we measured the jump height during three types of vertical jumps (squat jump [SJ], countermovement jump [CMJ], and rebound jump [RJ]) and the multi-joint leg extension power at three velocities (low, moderate, and high) of 30 healthy women. Using ultrasound elastography, the resting shear modulus of the vastus lateralis was assessed in the sitting position as an index of passive muscle mechanical properties. The results showed that the shear modulus was positively correlated with RJ height and multi-joint leg extension power at moderate and high velocities (r = 0.435-0.563, P < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the shear modulus and SJ height, CMJ height, and multi-joint leg extension power at low velocity. Contact time (i.e. the time under force exertion against the ground) during RJ (161 ± 19 ms) was 19% of that during CMJ (869 ± 171 ms). The results suggest that passive muscle mechanical properties play an important role in high-speed SSCs and dynamic explosive performance.HighlightsThe resting shear modulus was related to performance in stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) exercise involving a series of rapidly performed SSCs.The resting shear modulus was associated with muscular power in high-velocity conditions but not in low-velocity conditions.This study suggests that the passive mechanical properties of an agonist muscle play an important role in high-speed dynamic performance.",

J Strength Cond Res 39(2): 173-183, 2025-Exercise warm-up may include static or dynamic stretching, impacting performance differently. This study investigated the effects of various stretching protocols on isokinetic strength, muscular activity, and vertical jump performance. Sixteen subjects, divided evenly between trained and untrained groups, underwent 8 distinct stretching conditions in random order. Outcomes measured included isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque and power, muscular activity (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and biceps femoris), and jump performance (jump height and modified reactive strength index [RSImod]). Responses to the stretching conditions were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach. For isokinetic knee extension, dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist (DY-AG-ANT) and combined dynamic agonist with static antagonist stretching (DY-AG ST-ANT) produced significant improvements. Dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist increased peak torque by 12.72% and average torque by 30.80%, while DY-AG ST-ANT increased peak torque by 15.61% and average torque by 41.06%. Muscular activity also improved significantly; DY-AG ST-ANT increased EMG activity of the vastus lateralis by 29.43% and vastus medialis by 70.75%. Biceps femoris saw a 33.18% increase with DY-AG and a 22.15% increase with ST-AG. Countermovement jump height improved with DY-AG-ANT (12.6%) and static antagonist (ST-ANT) conditions (11.3%) ( p < 0.05). Dynamic stretching of both agonist and antagonist also enhanced average power knee extension by 32.41%, while ST-AG DY-ANT improved it by 31.09% ( p < 0.05).

Increasing fascicle length (FL) has been attempted in CP, the outcomes of which have been unsatisfactory. In healthy muscles, FL can be increased using eccentric exercise at high velocities (ECC). Three conditions are possibly met during such ECC: muscle micro-damage, positive fascicle strain, and momentary muscle deactivation during lengthening. Participants with and without CP underwent a single bout of passive stretching at (appropriately) high velocities using isokinetic dynamometry, during which we examined muscle and fascicle behaviour. Vastus lateralis (VL) FL change was measured using ultrasonography and showed positive fascicle strain. Measures of muscle creatine kinase were used to establish whether micro-damage occurred in response to stretching, but the results did not confirm damage in either group. Vastus medialis (VM) and biceps femoris muscle activity were measured using electromyography in those with CP. Results supported momentary spastic muscle deactivation during lengthening: all participants experienced at least one epoch (60 ms) of increased activation followed by activation inhibition/deactivation of the VM during knee flexion.

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) to visualize and assess myofascial mobility in healthy volunteers.SII was used to assess local shear strain at functional myofascial interfaces in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and thighs. In the FDP, MRE was performed at 90 Hz vibration to each index, middle, ring, and little finger. Two thigh MRE scans were performed at 40 Hz with knees flexed and extended. The normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) maps were calculated to visualize myofascial slip interfaces. The entropy of the probability distribution of the gradient NOSS was computed for the two knee positions at the intermuscular interface between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, around rectus femoris, and between vastus intermedius and vastus medialis.NOSS map depicted distinct functional slip interfaces in the FDP for each finger. Compared to knee flexion, clearer slip interfaces and larger gradient NOSS entropy at the vastus lateralis-vastus intermedius interface were observed during knee extension, where the quadriceps are not passively stretched. This suggests the optimal position for using SII to visualize myofascial slip interface in skeletal muscles is when muscles are not subjected to any additional force.The study demonstrated that MRE-based SII can visualize and assess myofascial interface mobility in extremities.

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

Many techniques have been described in the literature to restore knee flexion, with the most common one being an arthroscopic lysis of adhesions. However, in severe cases, additional intra- and extra-articular procedures are needed to restore full knee flexion. Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) is one of them. Unfortunately, it may lead to devastating complications, such as iatrogenic rupture of the patellar tendon or fractures of the patella or tibial tuberosity. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to present a safer modification of MUA for knee extension contracture in cases in which excessive force is demanded to achieve flexion.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an 8-week posterior and core strengthening program on APT, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) strength ratio, and vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.Ten healthy males (age = 26±12 years; mass = 87±14 kg; height = 1.8±0.1 m) and nine healthy females (age = 22±4 years; mass = 70±14 kg; heigh t = 1.7±0.1 m) performed resistance training (2×/week; 40-45 mins) involving a combination of hip extensors and abdominal strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. APT (°), vertical jump power (W), vertical jump height (m), and H:Q ratio at 60, 180, and 300°/s were assessed prior to and following the resistance training program.APT, vertical jump power, vertical jump height, and H:Q ratio at 60 and 180°/s, were significantly improved following 8 weeks of resistance training (all Ps<0.05).Our main finding was that 8 weeks of resistance training emphasizing posterior chain and core strengthening was effective in reducing APT, improving vertical jump performance and H:Q ratio in healthy individuals. Our findings have potential implications for clinicians prescribing resistance training exercises to improve pelvic posture in healthy asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing chronic low back pain and lumbar-spinal pathologies due to excessive anterior pelvic tilt.",

Forty-five healthy female soccer players were randomly divided into a regular stretching group, a regular stretching group with soleus stretching, and a control group. Dynamic stretching protocols were performed for 4 weeks during three sessions per week as part of routine exercises. The regular group stretched three muscle groups (i.e., gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and hamstrings), while the regular + soleus group also stretched the soleus muscle. Before and after the stretching intervention, the ankle range of motion test, Y-balance test, drop jump test, dynamic knee valgus test, and Illinois Agility Running Test were performed. Ankle ROM, Y-balance, and DJ significantly improved in both intervention groups compared to controls. Only the regular + soleus group showed improvement in the Illinois Agility Running Test. Additionally, athletes performing the additional soleus stretching had greater improvements in ankle ROM and DJ but not in DKV or Y-balance.

The second aim was to investigate possible variations in the stiffness levels of those tissues in different developmental stages.The stiffness levels of the GAT, PT, QT, and RF were measured in both limbs in 73 male basketball players aged 12 to 18 years. The reactive strength index (RSI), contact time (CT) and jump height (JH) during 30 and 40 cm DJs were also measured.Pearson correlation coefficients showed a significant association between DJ performance and PT, QT, GAT, and RF dynamic stiffness. Moreover, the youngest subjects were found to have lower stiffness values than the older ones.Tissue stiffness can affect athletic performance by modifying the stretch-shortening cycle in young basketball players.

Between-group differences were tested using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and the relationships between DOMS and MIVC, and SLFJ were examined using Pearson's correlation analysis. Results: The PPT at the vastus medialis and vastus lateral in the PBM combined with stretching group was significantly lower than that in control group at 72 h (p = 0.045) and 48 h (p = 0.037) postexercise.

We hypothesized that a prevention program could decrease the incidence of LBP in high school volleyball players.

The intervention program consisted of 9 physical function tests as well as 1 or 2 self-selected preventive exercises, including dynamic thoracic mobility, trunk stabilization exercises, and static stretching, performed during warm-up. Both groups were followed up for 4 weeks, during which the incidence of LBP was recorded. Physical function tests (back endurance; spinal and back flexibility; active or passive shoulder and trunk range of motion; ankle joint mobility; and iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings flexibility) were conducted before and after the intervention.The intervention group had a significantly lower incidence of LBP (8.8%) than the control group (33.3%) (relative risk, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-12.23; P = .017, 1 - β = 0.99).

Participants received one of the following interventions: standard treatment (ST group, n = 20), ST + PNF training (ST + PNF group, n = 20), ST + PNF training + TEAS intervention (ST + PNF + TEAS group, n = 20). All treatments lasted for six weeks. Participants' postural stability, muscle strength and pain were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention.After 3 weeks of intervention, Between-group comparisons showed that both the ST + PNF group and ST + PNF + TEAS group showed significantly greater performance than the ST group in the postural stability measure (P < 0.02) and pain score(P < 0.05). The peak torque of quadriceps extensors and flexors at the velocity of 60°/s was significantly higher in the ST + PNF + TEAS group than in the ST group (P < 0.02).

Muscle forces were estimated in OpenSim when hamstring optimal lengths changed in the range of 70-130% of the control case in 5% increments. The force and accumulated force of quadriceps muscle were calculated to evaluate the impact of hamstring optimal lengths on the loading on tibial tuberosity. The changes in muscle forces throughout the gait cycle were compared by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The average peak force and accumulated force of five gait cycles were compared.Although the maximum force of the quadriceps muscle was slightly affected by changes in hamstring optimal lengths, the accumulated force of quadriceps muscle increased by 21.97% with hamstring optimal lengths decreased by 30% of the control case. The increase of the muscle force mainly occurred in the early stance phase and terminal swing phase (P < 0.05). However, when hamstring optimal lengths were longer than the control, it had a little effect on accumulated force of quadriceps muscle.The results of this study indicate that a shorter hamstring optimal length, which means lack of flexibility, can cause a high accumulated force on tibial tuberosity, thus increasing the risk of OSD.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different numbers of interset proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching for the antagonists on the total number of repetitions completed for the agonists (quadriceps) in the leg extension exercise. Fourteen physically active individuals (age: 29.35 ± 10.5 years; body mass: 79.1 ± 11.34 kg; height: 170.4 ± 8.7 cm) participated in this study. The following experimental protocols were performed: 1) Traditional protocol (Traditional) - without previous stretching; 2) PNF with lesser duration (PNF1-3 sets of 20 secs.); 3) PNF with greater duration (PNF2-3 sets of 30 secs.). Within the experimental protocols (PNF1 and PNF2), stretching exercises for the antagonists were performed before and between the four sets of the unilateral leg extension exercise. All tests were performed on the dominant limb only. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the total number of repetitions for the PNF2 protocol versus the Traditional protocol (p = 0.026). However, there was no significant difference between the PNF1 protocol versus the Traditional protocol (p = 0.577).

Jump performance was assessed with a force plate, and tissue stiffness was assessed with a MyotonPro device.

Muscle strain injuries pertinent to the canine hip have been reported in the iliopsoas, pectineus, gracilis, sartorius, tensor fasciae latae, rectus femoris, and semitendinosus muscles. Physical diagnoses of this type of injury require palpation skills and the ability to specifically stretch the suspected musculotendinous tissue.

Physical treatments, preventative therapies, and rehabilitation could have a large role to play in the management of nonsurgical CHD patients with the goal to create the best possible musculoskeletal environment for pain-free hip function and to delay or prevent the onset of degenerative joint disease. Osteoarthritic hip joints can benefit from early detection and subsequent treatment. Physical therapists have long utilized manual testing techniques and clinical reasoning to diagnose early-onset joint osteoarthritis and therapeutic treatments consisting of correcting muscle dysfunctions, relieving pain, joint mobilizations, and advisement on lifestyle modifications could be equally beneficial to the canine patient. As well, sacroiliac joint dysfunctions may also afflict the dog.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of lengthened partial repetitions (LPs) vs. full range of motion (ROM) resistance training (RT) on muscular adaptations.In this within-participant study, thirty healthy, resistance-trained participants had their upper extremities randomly assigned to either a lengthened partial or full ROM condition; all other training variables were equivalent between limbs. The RT intervention was an 8-week program targeting upper-body musculature. Training consisted of two training sessions per week, with four exercises per session and four sets per exercise. Muscle hypertrophy of the elbow flexors and elbow extensors was evaluated using B-mode ultrasonography at 45% and 55% of humeral length. Muscle strength-endurance was assessed using a 10-repetition-maximum test on the lat pulldown exercise, both with a partial and full ROM. Data analysis employed a Bayesian framework with inferences made from posterior distributions and the strength of evidence for the existence of a difference through Bayes factors.Both muscle thickness and unilateral lat pulldown 10-repetition-maximum improvements were similar between the two conditions. Results were consistent across outcomes with point estimates close to zero, and Bayes factors (0.16 to 0.3) generally providing \"moderate\" support for the null hypothesis of equal improvement across interventions.Trainees seeking to maximize muscle size should likely emphasize the stretched position, either by using a full ROM or LPs during upper-body resistance training.

          "abstract": "Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction. Modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises have been proposed as a treatment method aimed at improving shoulder function and reducing pain in patients with SIS. However, the efficacy of these exercises remains controversial, necessitating a systematic meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate their effectiveness.A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating the efficacy of modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises in patients with SIS. Inclusion criteria required that participants be diagnosed with SIS, the intervention be modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises, and key outcomes such as shoulder function improvement and pain relief be reported. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, calculating standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity and bias risk were assessed.A total of 10 RCTs with 628 patients were included. The modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises demonstrated significant effects in reducing pain at rest (SMD = -1.00, 95% CI: -1.85 to -0.15, P = .02) and during activity (SMD = -1.45, 95% CI: -2.49 to -0.41, P = .006). Additionally, the exercises showed positive effects in improving internal rotation (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.22-0.75, P = .0003) and external rotation range of motion (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.00-0.58, P = .05), as well as enhancing shoulder function (CMS score: SMD = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.64-1.25, P .05).Modified posterior shoulder stretching exercises are significantly effective in improving shoulder function and reducing pain in patients with SIS, with the study results showing high robustness and low risk of bias.

          "abstract": "During the shortening of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs), muscle force output is enhanced compared with pure shortening (SHO), referred to as the SSC-effect. In general, muscle-tendon unit (MTU), muscle belly, muscle fascicle, and tendon length changes can be decoupled during contraction, which affects force generation and elastic recoil. We researched whether MTU decoupling contributes to the SSC-effect. Participants performed electrically stimulated submaximal fixed-end, SSC, and SHO plantar-flexions on a dynamometer at two velocities (40, 120°/s) and two ranges of motion (15, 25°). Fascicle and tendon length changes of the gastrocnemius medialis, and ankle joint kinematics were assessed by ultrasound and motion capture, respectively. During SSC shortening, ankle joint torque and work, MTU force and work, and fascicle force were increased by 12%-22% compared with SHO, confirming a SSC-effect. Further, fascicle length change and velocity during SSCs were significantly reduced compared with SHO condition, and SSC fascicle work was decreased by ~35%. Our results indicate that MTU decoupling leads to a reduction in fascicle shortening amplitude and velocity, thereby increasing the muscle's force capacity while reducing its work output during SSC shortening. MTU decoupling therefore contributes to the SSC-effect and underlines the limited transferability of joint work measurements to estimated muscle work.© 2024 The Author(s).

We previously reported that reduced joint stiffness due to repetitive hopping was associated with reduced active muscle stiffness. However, the determinants of active muscle stiffness endurance were unknown. This study aimed to compare the effects of repeated isometric contractions (ISO), which induced metabolic muscle fatigue, and repeated eccentric contractions (ECC), which induced muscle damage, on active muscle stiffness endurance.Fourteen males performed two kinds of fatigue tasks (ISO and ECC) using only ankle joint. Before and after the fatigue tasks, changes in estimated muscle force and fascicle length during fast stretching were used to calculate the active muscle stiffness of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. In addition, the thickness of the plantar flexor muscles was measured before and after fatigue tasks.After fatigue tasks, no difference in the relative increase of muscle thickness was found between ISO and ECC. The increase in torque during fast stretching did not change after both ISO and ECC. The increase in fascicle length during fast stretching significantly increased after ECC but not ISO. Active muscle stiffness significantly decreased after ECC but not ISO.Active muscle stiffness decreased after repeated eccentric contractions damaging fascicles and did not change with repeated isometric contractions causing metabolic fatigue. These results implied that the joint stiffness reduction due to repetitive stretch-shortening cycle exercises shown in previous studies involved a reduction in active muscle stiffness due to repeated eccentric contractions.",

All treatment groups (control, ICE and ISE) underwent 10 sessions of physiotherapy treatment at a frequency of three per week. The flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) for back muscles was investigated as the primary outcome measure.No significant differences were detected in FRR of back muscles at the end of the study between three study groups (all p > 0.05). In all groups after interventions, no significant changes in FRR compared to the baseline values were observed (within changes were not significant; all p > 0.05). The pairwise comparisons of the between groups revealed that the disability scores in the ISE group compared to ICE, were significantly lower (F = 5.53; df = 2; P = 0.009).Neither stretching nor compression exercises affected FRR more than the control group in DGS patients.

Following a 48-h washout period, the interventions were swapped between the respective groups. Both groups underwent assessments averaging three countermovement vertical jumps (CVJ) with hands on hips and three VJ with arms free. Measurement was taken using the Encoder - Ergonauta I, with over 1500 jumps recorded. The participants were evaluated for their level of flexibility and VJ performance using the Jump Sigma Index application.an acute decrease in average performance was identified, amounting to 3.86 % for the CMJ with hands on hips and 3.06% for the CVJ with free hands, following PNF in the agonists.there was no statistical difference between the means before and after the intervention when PNF was applied to the antagonistic hamstring muscles. The CVJ modalities with hands on hips and with free hands presented statistically similar indices.

This study aims to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive corrective exercise program (CCEP) on the range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation in female athletes with limited weight-bearing lunge ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. 30 female athletes aged 15 to 25 years with dorsiflexion under 34° were randomized to two groups. The intervention group (n = 15) received eight weeks of CCEP including soft tissue mobilization, joint mobilization, stretching, and strengthening, and the control (n = 15) group did not receive any intervention. range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation were assessed before and after the intervention. The training group showed clinically acceptable and statistically significant changes in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ES = 0.714), balance (ES = 0.423), and proprioception (ES = 0.253; P 0.05). The findings show that CCEP appears to be beneficial in increasing dorsiflexion range of motion, proprioception, balance, and decreasing ankle muscle activity among individuals with limited ankle dorsiflexion. Improving the dorsiflexion range of motion may be promising for reducing ankle sprain injury.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Potential influences of muscle fatigue of extensor muscles have not been explored.A total of 20 asymptomatic subjects performed submaximal isometric trunk extension exertions and an isokinetic trunk flexion before and immediately after 5-minute static flexion while the trunk sagittal flexion angle and the myoelectric activities (electromyography [EMG]) of back extensor muscles were recorded simultaneously. Changes in the flexion-relaxation onset angle, maximum flexion angle, muscle activity level, and the median power frequency of EMG associated with the static flexion were evaluated.Flexion-relaxation onset angle in isokinetic flexion and EMG amplitude of isometric extension were significantly greater after static flexion, indicating creep of spinal tissues in static flexion. Median power frequency of lumbar erector spinae EMG during isometric extension was significantly lower after static flexion, suggesting the development of muscle fatigue. Consistent but low level of EMG was observed together with sporadic muscle spasms during the static flexion period.Fatigue of low back extensor muscles may occur in static flexion due to prolonged passive stretching of the muscles. Low back extensor muscles are required to generate more active forces in weight holding or lifting after static flexion to compensate for the reduced contribution of creep deformed passive tissues in maintaining spinal stability and the posture. The degraded force generating capacity of the fatigued muscles can be a significant risk factor for low back pain.",

          "abstract": "Full flexion lumbar postures maintained over a prolonged period of time have been shown to lead to changes in the supporting passive structures of the spine and it has been hypothesized that this may lead to low back pain/disorders. However, the specific biomechanics and physiology of this link have not been fully developed. Of particular interest is the interplay between the active and passive extensor mechanisms and the role of rest break in this response.Ten healthy participants performed a regimen of a 10-min full lumbar flexion followed by a 10-min upright standing, with a slow speed isokinetic lift every 2.5min. Changes in the full lumbar flexion angle (system creep) and the electromyographic activity of back extensors in the isokinetic lifts were evaluated.Results showed significant increases in the full flexion angle and increased activity of the extensor muscles in the prolonged flexion to compensate for the reduced extension moment producing capability of the passive tissues. A 30-s rest break in the middle of the flexion moderated these viscoelastic responses.The results suggest that prolonged lumbar flexion results in the systematic transfer of an extension moment from passive tissues to active muscles. Heavy lifting or high force exertion of back muscles immediately after prolonged flexion could be a risk factor for low back disorders when the muscles lose their force generating capacity due to passive stretching. This study also indicated the importance of sufficient rest between consecutive full flexion tasks in reducing the risk.",

          "title": "Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (Greater Trochanteric Bursitis)",
          "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with lateral hip pain are commonly treated for trochanteric bursitis using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. While effective for many, this approach still leaves many patients with ongoing discomfort and limited functionality. Recent advancements in understanding have led to the recognition of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) as a more accurate descriptor of this condition. GTPS encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. Trochanteric bursitis, the predominant cause of GTPS, involves inflammation of the greater trochanteric bursa, which is located between the greater trochanter and the iliotibial band. This inflammation is commonly triggered by repetitive stress and trauma. The condition manifests as pain in the lateral thigh, often aggravated by prolonged sitting, stair climbing, or engaging in high-impact exercises. The hip joint, bearing loads of 6 to 8 times the body weight during everyday activities, is particularly vulnerable to wear and tear. The diagnosis of GTPS is primarily clinical, with imaging used to differentiate it from other potential causes. A deep understanding of the relevant anatomy, clinical examination findings, and imaging results is essential in managing cases resistant to conservative treatment. The standard treatment includes NSAIDs, physical therapy, and stretching exercises. Surgical intervention, both open and endoscopic, is reserved for cases where conservative methods are ineffective. Involved Anatomical Structures Dysfunction at any anatomical junction can manifest as greater trochanteric pain syndrome. The peritrochanteric space contains important anatomical structures that enable hip motion and stability. A key structure is the subgluteus maximus bursa, also called the trochanteric bursa, which cushions movements of the overlying gluteus tendons, iliotibial band, and tensor fascia lata. The peritrochanteric space is superficially covered by a fibromuscular sheath comprising the gluteus maximus, tensor fascia lata, and iliotibial band. Underneath lie the hip abductor and stabilizer muscles. The gluteus minimus stabilizes the femoral head, originating from the pelvis and inserting at the greater trochanter. The larger gluteus medius also inserts at the greater trochanter, initiates hip abduction, and stabilizes the femoral head. Finally, the tensor fascia lata forms the prime hip abductor. Proper functioning of these muscular and connective tissue structures enables painless motion and transfers weight laterally from the hip during gait. Copyright © 2025, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",

However, it has not been compared with various PHE exercises in individuals with iliopsoas shortness.This study compared pelvic compensation and hip and back extensor muscle activities in individuals with iliopsoas shortness during prone hip extension (PHE) using the abdominal drawing-in maneuver alone (PHEA) and after iliopsoas stretching (PHEAS).Twenty-five individuals with iliopsoas shortness were included in the study. Electromyography was used to investigate bilateral erector spinae (ES) and ipsilateral gluteus maximus (GM), biceps femoris (BF), and semitendinosus (ST) muscles during PHE, PHEA, and PHEAS. Pelvic anterior tilting and rotation angles were measured during each PHE exercise via electromagnetic motion tracking. A modified Thomas test was used to examine the hip extension angle before and after iliopsoas stretching. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to investigate differences in pelvic anterior tilting and rotation angle and in hip and back extensor muscle activities among PHE, PHEA, and PHEAS. The level of statistical significance was set at α= 0.01.GM muscle activity was significantly greater with PHEAS, compared to PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01). Bilateral ES and ipsilateral BF and ST muscle activities were significantly reduced with PHEAS, compared to PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01). Anterior pelvic tilting and rotation angles were significantly reduced with PHEAS, compared to PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01).PHEAS is recommended to selectively strengthen GM muscles with minimal BF and ST muscle activities and pelvic compensation in individuals with iliopsoas shortness.

          "abstract": "Performing static stretching (SS) during resistance training (RT) rest periods is posited to potentiate muscular adaptations, but the literature is scarce on the topic. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adding inter-set SS to a lower-limb flywheel RT program on joint flexibility, muscular strength, and regional hypertrophy. Sixteen untrained male adults (21 ± 1 y) completed the study, where they performed progressive flywheel bilateral squatting twice a week for 5 weeks. One leg of each participant was randomly allocated to perform SS during the inter-set rest period (RT+SS), while the other leg served as control (RT only). Before and after the intervention, knee flexion range of motion; knee extension isometric, concentric, and eccentric peak torque; 1-repetition maximum; and muscle thickness of the lower-limb muscles were assessed. Following the training period, additional effects were observed for the inter-set SS side on increasing joint flexibility (p < 0.05), whereas the average increase in strength measures was 5.3% for the control side, and 10.1% for the inter-set SS side, however, SS intervention induced significantly greater gains only for knee extension isometric strength, but not for dynamic 1-RM, concentric, and eccentric tests. Hamstrings and gluteus maximus did not hypertrophy with training; increases quadriceps muscle thickness depended on the site/portion analyzed, but no significant difference was observed between legs (average: RT = 7.3%, RT+SS = 8.0%). The results indicate that adding inter-set SS to RT may provide large gains in flexibility, slightly benefits for muscular strength (especially for isometric action), but do not impact muscle hypertrophy in untrained young men.",

          "abstract": "Objective To assess the relationship between static frontal knee alignment in asymptomatic subjects and flexibility of the main muscles functionally related to the knee. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 33 healthy adults (19-31 years). The frontal knee angle (valgus/varus angle) was measured by photogrammetry and it was measured in the lateral side. Therefore, high values were assigned for genu varum and low values for genu valgum. Iliopsoas, gluteus maximus and medius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, vastus of the quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles were stretched. Muscles were classified as normal, reflex hypomobile, or structural hypomobile. Results Women had significantly greater valgus than did men (right angle, women: 174.41°/men: 177.41°; left angle, women: 174.20°/men: 178.70°). The right frontal plane knee angle was higher in women with structural hypomobile vastus. The left frontal plane knee angle was higher in women with structural hypomobile iliopsoas. No relationships were found in men. Conclusions A tighter vastus of the quadriceps and tighter iliopsoas are related to greater genu varum in adult women. Stretching the vastus of the quadriceps and iliopsoas when there is a tendency for excess varus in the knee, to prevent overuse injury or early osteoarthritis, might be clinically relevant.",

The recruitment criteria included age (10-13 years), no pain, injury or musculoskeletal disorder throughout the previous year, physical activity limited to school sport. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) post-isometric relaxation - PIR (n = 40), (2) static stretch combined with stabilizing exercises - SS (n = 40) and (3) stabilizing exercises - SE (n = 40). Hamstring flexibility was assessed with straight leg raise (SLR), popliteal angle (PA) and finger-to-floor (FTF) tests. The examinations were conducted by blinded observers twice, prior to the program and a week after the last session with the physiotherapist. Twenty-six children who did not participate in all six exercise sessions with physiotherapists were excluded from the analysis. The results obtained by 94 children were analyzed (PIR, n = 32; SS, n = 31; SE, n = 31). In the PIR and SS groups, a significant (P 0.05). SLR result in the PIR and SS groups was significantly (P<0.001) higher than in the SE group. As far as PA results are concerned, a significant difference was observed only between the SS and SE groups (P = 0.014). There were no significant (P = 0.15) differences regarding FTF results between the three groups. Post-isometric muscle relaxation and static stretch with stabilizing exercises led to a similar increase in hamstring flexibility and trunk forward bend in healthy 10-13-year-old children. The exercises limited to straightening gluteus maximus improved the SLR result, but did not change the PA and FTF results.",

          "abstract": "Back extension exercises are often used in the rehabilitation of low back pain. However, at present it is not clear how the posterior muscles are recruited during different types of extension exercises. Therefore, the present study will evaluate the myoelectric activity of thoracic, lumbar and hip extensor muscles during different extension exercises in healthy persons. Based on these physiological observations we will make recommendations regarding the use of extensions exercises in clinical practice.Fourteen healthy subjects performed four standardized extension exercises (dynamic trunk extension, dynamic-static trunk extension, dynamic leg extension, dynamic-static leg extension) in randomized order at an intensity of 60% of 1-RM (one repetition maximum). Surface EMG signals of Latissimus dorsi (LD), Longissimus thoracis pars thoracic (LTT) and lumborum (LTL), Iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracic (ILT) and lumborum (ILL), lumbar Multifidus (LM) and Gluteus Maximus (GM) were measured during the various exercises. Subsequently, EMG root mean square values were calculated and compared between trunk and leg extension exercises, as well as between a dynamic and dynamic-static performance using mixed model analysis. During the dynamic exercises a 2 second concentric contraction was followed by a 2 second eccentric contraction, whereas in the dynamic-static performance, a 5 second isometric interval was added in between the concentric and eccentric contraction phase.In general, the muscles of the posterior chain were recruited on a higher level during trunk extension (mean ± SD, 56.6 ± 30.8%MVC) compared to leg extension (47.4 ± 30.3%MVC) (p ≤ 0.001). No significant differences were found in mean muscle activity between dynamic and dynamic-static performances (p = 0.053). The thoracic muscles (LTT and ILT) were recruited more during trunk extension (64.9 ± 27.1%MVC) than during leg extension (54.2 ± 22.1%MVC) (p = 0.045) without significant differences in activity between both muscles (p = 0.138). There was no significant differences in thoracic muscle usage between the dynamic or dynamic-static performance of the extension exercises (p = 0.574).The recruitment of the posterior muscle chain during different types of extension exercises was influenced by the moving body part, but not by the type of contraction. All muscle groups were activated at a higher degree during trunk extension compared to leg extension. Based on the recruitment level of the different muscles, all exercises can be used to improve the endurance capacity of thoracic muscles, however for improvement of lumbar muscle endurance leg extension exercises seem to be more appropriate.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the influence of fast dynamic stretching (FDS) of the gluteus maximus muscle on rate of force development.This study included 12 healthy ice hockey players. The intervention was based on a fast dynamic stretching of the gluteus maximus muscle. For quantification, measurements were performed before and after the intervention. The rate of force development was determined by using the drop jump (DJ) for ground contact time and jump height, and sprint time was measured on ice over 20 meters.The intervention showed significant extension of the ground reaction time. The jump height and the sprint time showed no significant differences after FDS intervention.The data in this present randomised controlled pilot study showed that FDS interventions on the gluteus maximus muscle have no influence on rate of force development. For future studies, it is recommended that the study protocol should be modified with regard to determining the stretched muscle groups.

As such, interventions for EAMC typically consist of stretching/strengthening of the involved muscle and/or supplements to restore electrolyte imbalances.The patient was a 42-year-old male triathlete with a primary complaint of recurrent cramping of his right hamstring muscle, which prevented him from completing races at his desired pace. Strength testing revealed gluteus maximus muscle weakness bilaterally. Electromyographic (EMG) analysis (surface electrodes, 1560 Hz) revealed that the right hamstrings were being activated excessively during terminal swing and the first half of the stance phase (48.1% maximum voluntary isometric contraction [MVIC]).Following the intervention, the patient was able to complete 3 triathlons without hamstring cramping. Strength testing revealed that the right hip extension strength improved from 35.6 to 54.7 kg, and activation of the hamstrings during terminal swing and the first half of the stance phase decreased to 36.4% of MVIC.A program of gluteus maximus strengthening and neuromuscular training eliminated EAMC of the hamstrings in this patient. Given that the hamstrings and gluteus maximus work as agonists to decelerate the thigh during terminal swing phase and control hip flexion during loading response of running, we postulate that strengthening of the gluteus maximus decreased the relative effort required by the hamstrings, thus reducing EAMC. The results of the EMG evaluation that was performed as part of this case report provides support for this hypothesis.Therapy, level 4.",

This study aims to examine the effects of different muscle relaxation techniques on the physical properties of the trapezius muscle and to explore how changes in the physical properties of the upper trapezius muscle affect those of the middle trapezius muscle.

Measurements using the Myoton digital muscle assessment system were conducted daily over 2 weeks. The experimental groups demonstrated a notable decrease in tension and stiffness, accompanied by heightened elasticity in the upper trapezius muscles. Conversely, the control group exhibited contrasting trends. Although no significant variances were detected among the relaxation techniques, all proved efficacious compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, relaxation of the upper trapezius muscles significantly influenced the middle trapezius muscles (P < 0.05).

RSP can lead to shoulder dysfunction. Different methods have been proposed for rehabilitating and correcting the altered posture in RSP including stretching, strengthening exercises, and shoulder brace or taping. However, the findings are controversial and studies are ongoing to develop more effective method. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of scapular posterior tilting (SPT) exercise in different support positions on scapular muscle activities in men and women with RSP. In a prospective observational clinical study, we assessed demographic, basic clinical parameters and study variables of the subjects with RSP (n = 20) (men/women = 9/11) attending Daegu University in Gyeongsan, South Korea. To do so, we compared electromyographic (EMG) activities of lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles between men and women with RSP during SPT exercise on four different support surfaces to determine any difference in the EMG activities. The results revealed that women showed significant differences in EMG activities in the lower and left upper trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, while men showed significant differences in EMG activity only in the lower trapezius muscle during SPT exercise on four different surfaces (P 0.0125).© 2024.

Differences in the shear moduli of the levator scapulae, serratus anterior, and rhomboid minor muscles were measured in the resting and levator scapulae stretching positions using shear wave elastography. The correlation between the rates of change for each muscle was also verified.The results demonstrated a notable increase in the shear modulus from the resting to stretching positions for levator scapulae (42.9 ± 17.6 kPa vs. 52.4 ± 15.2 kPa) and serratus anterior (32.8 ± 12.9 kPa vs. 58.4 ± 18.5 kPa) (P = 0.02, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the shear modulus for the rhomboid minor between the resting (44.0 ± 19.2 kPa) and stretching (41.0 ± 20.2 kPa) positions (P = 0.40). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between rates of change for the levator scapulae and serratus anterior muscles (P = 0.04, r = 0.459).These findings indicate that the shear modulus of the serratus anterior increased with the stretching of the levator scapulae, suggesting the occurrence of epimuscular myofascial force transmission between these two muscles with different muscle insertions.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Traditional Thai massage (TTM) is a unique form of whole body massage practiced to promote health and well-being in Thailand since ancient times. The goal of the present study was to create a standardised TTM protocol to treat office syndrome (OS) diagnosed based on the identification of the palpation of at least one so-called myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in the upper trapezius muscle. The new 90 min TTM protocol, which was developed following appropriate review of the literature and in consultation with relevant experts, has 25 distinct steps (20 pressing steps, 2 artery occlusion steps, and 3 stretching steps). Eleven TTM therapists treated three patients each using the new 90 min TTM protocol. All of the therapists reported scores greater than 80% in respect to their satisfaction and confidence to deliver the protocol, and all of the patients gave the treatment a satisfaction score of greater than 80%. The treatment produced a significant reduction in pain intensity measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 10 cm, of 2.33 cm (95% CI (1.76, 2.89 cm), p < 0.001) and significant increase in pain pressure threshold (PPT) of 0.37 kg/cm2 (95% CI (0.10, 0.64 kg/cm2), p < 0.05). The protocol was revised based on the feedback and the results obtained, and the new standardised TTM protocol will be applied in a randomised control trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of TTM and conventional physical therapy (PT) for treating OS.",

Maximal elevation of the upper limb was passively added to all positions. The shear elastic modulus, used as the index of muscle elongation, was measured at the four parts (upper, middle, lower, distal parts) of the LD. The shear elastic moduli showed obviously high values in Rot and LB + Rot at the upper, middle, and distal parts, and also in LB, Rot, and LB + Rot at the lower part.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a six week exercise program to reduce the muscle tone of the trapezius and musculoskeletal discomfort (MED) of office workers. Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67). In conclusion, MED appears to improve in office workers after a six week training program, which may be explained by a decrease in trapezius tone and increase in the left middle trapezius tone.",

However, a daily report of pain reduction has not been determined.The aim was to evaluate the time of the greatest pain relief after performing a single session of DN in MTrPs of the upper trapezius muscle.A patient who had MTrPs in the upper trapezius muscle was enrolled into a prospective descriptive study. Each patient received a single session of DN, using a fast-in-fast-out technique, with needle retention for 30 min. Numerical rating scale (NRS) scores were collected daily for 14 days. The mean difference of pain and an effect size were calculated. The 1-5 satisfaction score was a secondary outcome.Sixty-seven subjects completed the intervention. The mean duration of the symptom was 27.32 months. The mean baseline NRS score was 5.30. The pain decreased significantly between immediate post-procedure and 1 day after the DN treatment from 5.16 to 3.40 (mean difference 1.76, p < 0.01, effect size = 0.87).

Biomechanical Taping (BMT), a novel intervention, may provide equally effective management.This paper reports on the effectiveness of Biomechanical Taping compared with Kinesio Taping in improving shoulder pain, active range of motion (AROM), and function.Two groups of participants with TM were recruited through simple random sampling of participants from nine call centers and purposively-sampled participants from one fast-food chain and one community based rehabilitation center in Manila, Philippines. Participants were randomly allocated to either Kinesio Taping or biomechanical taping group in a double-blind clinical trial. Irrespective of the type of taping, participants performed gentle passive stretching of upper trapezius for six times each held for 30 s on Days 1, 3, and 5. On Days 2 and 4, participants performed gentle passive stretch of upper trapezius three times a day. Pre- and post-intervention measures were taken of Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity, AROM for shoulder movement, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand for function.Of 68 participants, 62 had shoulder symptoms secondary to TM. Similar significant within group improvements were found for Visual Analogue Scale scores, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand for biomechanical taping and Kinesio Taping interventions when comparing between group results (p < 0.05).Biomechanical Taping appears to be as effective as Kinesio Taping in the short term in decreasing pain and improving function of individuals with TM.

          "abstract": "The lumbar paraspinal muscle compartment (PMC) is a stabilizing system of the spine whose efficiency depends on its elastic properties, which may be quantifiable by supersonic shear wave elastography (SWE). The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) encapsulates the lumbar paraspinal muscles (LPM) and creates a PMC. Tensioning of the TLF via the stretching of the latissimus dorsi is supposed to increase stiffness within the PMC. The aims of this study were (1) to test the reliability of SWE in the multifidus and the erector spinae (ES) in prone and sited position; (2) to investigate the role of the tensioning of the pTLF, via stretching of the latissimus dorsi (LD), on LPM stiffness. Stiffness of ES and multifidus was measured using SWE at L3-L4 in procubitus and seated position in 15 participants. Stretching of LD was performed with arm elevation. Parametric paired tests, multiple analyses of variance, and intraclass correlation were used for statistical analysis. Reliability estimates were fair to excellent. Reliability was greater in ES than the multifidus, greater in seated position than during rest. Stiffness was greater in the ES than in multifidus, and in seated position than at rest. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not generate significant LPM stiffness changes. SWE is a reliable tool for assessing stiffness in the LPM. Reliability of SWE protocols is improved during seated position. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not influence LPM stiffness. Clin.

The understanding of mechanisms, including the peripheral balance between nociceptive and antinociceptive processes, is incomplete.

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of two NAEs: the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type-α ligand palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and stearoylethanolamide (SEA) in the muscle interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP randomized to two different neck specific training programs and in a healthy pain-free control group (CON).Fifty-seven women with CNSP were randomized to strength + stretch or stretch alone exercise programs. Twenty-nine subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months of exercise. Twenty-four CON subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months without any intervention in between. Microdialysate samples were collected from the trapezius muscle and analyzed by mass spectrometry for PEA and SEA levels.PEA and SEA levels were significantly higher in CNSP patients compared with CON. PEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after both training programs. SEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after stretch alone but not after strength + stretch training. A significant positive correlation was found between changes in pain intensity and in SEA levels in the strength + stretch group, but not in the stretch alone group.Our results indicate that exercise interventions differentially affect the levels of the bioactive lipids PEA and SEA in the interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP.Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This study aims to examine the effects of different muscle relaxation techniques on the physical properties of the trapezius muscle and to explore how changes in the physical properties of the upper trapezius muscle affect those of the middle trapezius muscle. Twenty-four healthy males (mean age: 23.08 ± 0.97 years; height: 172.42 ± 4.61 cm; weight: 66.38 ± 6.68 kg; and body mass index: 22.30 ± 1.81 kg/m2), randomly divided into four groups: stretching relaxation group (ST, n = 6), mechanical vibration massage (MV, n = 6), pulse massage (PU, n = 6), and control (CO, n = 6). Measurements using the Myoton digital muscle assessment system were conducted daily over 2 weeks. The experimental groups demonstrated a notable decrease in tension and stiffness, accompanied by heightened elasticity in the upper trapezius muscles. Conversely, the control group exhibited contrasting trends. Although no significant variances were detected among the relaxation techniques, all proved efficacious compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, relaxation of the upper trapezius muscles significantly influenced the middle trapezius muscles (P < 0.05).

RSP can lead to shoulder dysfunction. Different methods have been proposed for rehabilitating and correcting the altered posture in RSP including stretching, strengthening exercises, and shoulder brace or taping. However, the findings are controversial and studies are ongoing to develop more effective method. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of scapular posterior tilting (SPT) exercise in different support positions on scapular muscle activities in men and women with RSP. In a prospective observational clinical study, we assessed demographic, basic clinical parameters and study variables of the subjects with RSP (n = 20) (men/women = 9/11) attending Daegu University in Gyeongsan, South Korea. To do so, we compared electromyographic (EMG) activities of lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles between men and women with RSP during SPT exercise on four different support surfaces to determine any difference in the EMG activities. The results revealed that women showed significant differences in EMG activities in the lower and left upper trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, while men showed significant differences in EMG activity only in the lower trapezius muscle during SPT exercise on four different surfaces (P 0.0125).© 2024.

Methods: A convenience sample of 60 patients with neck pain and active trigger points were recruited from physiotherapy students and allocated randomly to three groups INIT plus stretching exercise spray and stretch technique plus stretching exercise, and stretching exercise only. Treatment was three times per week for four weeks. Pain intensity by visual analogue scale (VAS), pain pressure threshold (PPT), neck disability by Arabic neck disability index (ANDI), and muscle amplitude in the form of root mean square (RMS) by electromyography (EMG) were measured at baseline and after four weeks. Results: Between groups analysis; the results revealed statistical significant difference between three groups after four weeks of intervention as p =0.0001. Within the group analysis, post hoc tests reported improvement at all variables in both INIT and spray and stretch technique groups with mean differences 64.5 and 65.1 in VAS, 20 and 18.15 in ANDI, -1.45 and -0.81 in PPT, and 2.47 and 1.88 in muscle amplitude, respectively.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a six week exercise program to reduce the muscle tone of the trapezius and musculoskeletal discomfort (MED) of office workers. Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67). In conclusion, MED appears to improve in office workers after a six week training program, which may be explained by a decrease in trapezius tone and increase in the left middle trapezius tone.",

          "abstract": "Trapezius Myalgia (TM) is characterized by shoulder pain and dysfunction. Kinesio Taping is commonly used in symptom management of TM. Biomechanical Taping (BMT), a novel intervention, may provide equally effective management.This paper reports on the effectiveness of Biomechanical Taping compared with Kinesio Taping in improving shoulder pain, active range of motion (AROM), and function.Two groups of participants with TM were recruited through simple random sampling of participants from nine call centers and purposively-sampled participants from one fast-food chain and one community based rehabilitation center in Manila, Philippines. Participants were randomly allocated to either Kinesio Taping or biomechanical taping group in a double-blind clinical trial. Irrespective of the type of taping, participants performed gentle passive stretching of upper trapezius for six times each held for 30 s on Days 1, 3, and 5. On Days 2 and 4, participants performed gentle passive stretch of upper trapezius three times a day.

Similar significant within group improvements were found for Visual Analogue Scale scores, and Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand for biomechanical taping and Kinesio Taping interventions when comparing between group results (p < 0.05).Biomechanical Taping appears to be as effective as Kinesio Taping in the short term in decreasing pain and improving function of individuals with TM.

          "abstract": "The lumbar paraspinal muscle compartment (PMC) is a stabilizing system of the spine whose efficiency depends on its elastic properties, which may be quantifiable by supersonic shear wave elastography (SWE). The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) encapsulates the lumbar paraspinal muscles (LPM) and creates a PMC. Tensioning of the TLF via the stretching of the latissimus dorsi is supposed to increase stiffness within the PMC. The aims of this study were (1) to test the reliability of SWE in the multifidus and the erector spinae (ES) in prone and sited position; (2) to investigate the role of the tensioning of the pTLF, via stretching of the latissimus dorsi (LD), on LPM stiffness. Stiffness of ES and multifidus was measured using SWE at L3-L4 in procubitus and seated position in 15 participants. Stretching of LD was performed with arm elevation. Parametric paired tests, multiple analyses of variance, and intraclass correlation were used for statistical analysis. Reliability estimates were fair to excellent. Reliability was greater in ES than the multifidus, greater in seated position than during rest. Stiffness was greater in the ES than in multifidus, and in seated position than at rest. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not generate significant LPM stiffness changes. SWE is a reliable tool for assessing stiffness in the LPM. Reliability of SWE protocols is improved during seated position. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not influence LPM stiffness. Clin.

The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the difference between therapist administered and self-administered interventions.Three arm assessor-blinded Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT).Fifty-eight asymptomatic participants (16 Males; Mean age 22.69 ± 2.65 years).Participants with tight hamstrings defined by a passive Knee Extension Angle (KEA) > 20° were included in the study and were assigned to one of the three groups. Group A (n = 19) was SS, group B (n = 20) was remote MFR, group C (n = 19) was a combination group who received both SS and remote MFR. Seven sessions of therapist administered intervention were delivered over a period of 10 days, which was followed by a 2-week self-administered home program. KEA and Sit and Reach Test (SRT) were used as outcomes and measurements were performed at baseline, end of the seventh session and after atwo-week follow-up.The results demonstrated that hamstring flexibility improved in all three groups after therapist administered interventions (p 0.05) change in the KEA with self-intervention.The findings of this study indicated that all three interventions were effective in improving hamstring flexibility in young asymptomatic individuals when performed by the therapist.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Activation of the upper trapezius during 20 minutes of computer keyboard work was measured by electromyography, and four consecutive 5-minute segments were analyzed.The vertical distance from the seventh cervical process to the acromion, and the horizontal distance from the inferior angle to the same level of the spinal process were significantly increased after keyboard typing work compared with before keyboard typing work (p<0.05). The average value of the upper trapezius activity increased with increased time at the keyboard. The percent reference voluntary contraction of phase 1 (from start to 5 minutes) was lower than those of phase 2 (from 5 to 10 minutes), and phase 3 (from 10 to 15 minutes) (p<0.05).We observed that sustained computer work changed the scapular position in the stretched upper trapezius.

          "abstract": "Resistance training using different ranges of motion may produce varying effects on musclular adaptations. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of lengthened partial repetitions (LPs) vs. full range of motion (ROM) resistance training (RT) on muscular adaptations.In this within-participant study, thirty healthy, resistance-trained participants had their upper extremities randomly assigned to either a lengthened partial or full ROM condition; all other training variables were equivalent between limbs. The RT intervention was an 8-week program targeting upper-body musculature. Training consisted of two training sessions per week, with four exercises per session and four sets per exercise. Muscle hypertrophy of the elbow flexors and elbow extensors was evaluated using B-mode ultrasonography at 45% and 55% of humeral length. Muscle strength-endurance was assessed using a 10-repetition-maximum test on the lat pulldown exercise, both with a partial and full ROM. Data analysis employed a Bayesian framework with inferences made from posterior distributions and the strength of evidence for the existence of a difference through Bayes factors.Both muscle thickness and unilateral lat pulldown 10-repetition-maximum improvements were similar between the two conditions. Results were consistent across outcomes with point estimates close to zero, and Bayes factors (0.16 to 0.3) generally providing \"moderate\" support for the null hypothesis of equal improvement across interventions.Trainees seeking to maximize muscle size should likely emphasize the stretched position, either by using a full ROM or LPs during upper-body resistance training. For muscle strength-endurance, our findings suggest that LPs and full ROM elicit similar adaptations.© 2025 Wolf et al.",

Before and after heating (30 min) and non-heating (control) conditions, the mechanical properties of the Achilles tendon during ramp and ballistic contractions and two kinds of jumps (no-countermovement and countermovement jumps) were measured. In addition, electromyographic activities of the plantar flexor muscles (medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles) and oxygen consumption were measured during 5 min of submaximal repetitive jumps after both interventions (heating and control).Although no changes in tendon elongation at all force levels and elastic energy during ramp and ballistic contractions were observed, tendon hysteresis decreased by 14.2% during ramp contraction (p = 0.015 according to the paired t-test) and 8.0% during ballistic contraction (p = 0.006 according to the paired t-test) after heating. No changes in no-countermovement and countermovement jump heights were found after both interventions. The electromyographic activities of gastrocnemius muscles at the first half and soleus muscle at all time points were significantly lower for heating than for control conditions. No difference in oxygen consumption was found between heating and control conditions.These results suggest that heating reduces tendon hysteresis and enhances efficiency (assessed by electromyographic activity) during repetitive submaximal jumps.Copyright © 2025 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",

Ultrasound muscle architecture (muscle thickness [MT], fascicle length [FL], and pennation angle [PA]) measurements were collected at multiple sites at four weekly baseline sessions, six (mid) and 12 (post1) weeks following the commencement of the intervention, and a week after the intervention (post2) while isometric strength and range of motion (RoM) were obtained once at baseline, mid, post1, and post2. 2SD band plots were constructed to determine meaningful changes in MT, FL, and PA from the four baseline measures while percentage and absolute change across each timepoint were calculated for all variables. From baseline to post 1, RoM, strength, and MT increased 25.9%, 11.4%, and 7.4%-23.4%, respectively, while four MT and two PA sites exceeded the threshold for meaningful change.

          "abstract": "During the shortening of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs), muscle force output is enhanced compared with pure shortening (SHO), referred to as the SSC-effect. In general, muscle-tendon unit (MTU), muscle belly, muscle fascicle, and tendon length changes can be decoupled during contraction, which affects force generation and elastic recoil. We researched whether MTU decoupling contributes to the SSC-effect. Participants performed electrically stimulated submaximal fixed-end, SSC, and SHO plantar-flexions on a dynamometer at two velocities (40, 120°/s) and two ranges of motion (15, 25°). Fascicle and tendon length changes of the gastrocnemius medialis, and ankle joint kinematics were assessed by ultrasound and motion capture, respectively. During SSC shortening, ankle joint torque and work, MTU force and work, and fascicle force were increased by 12%-22% compared with SHO, confirming a SSC-effect. Further, fascicle length change and velocity during SSCs were significantly reduced compared with SHO condition, and SSC fascicle work was decreased by ~35%. Our results indicate that MTU decoupling leads to a reduction in fascicle shortening amplitude and velocity, thereby increasing the muscle's force capacity while reducing its work output during SSC shortening. MTU decoupling therefore contributes to the SSC-effect and underlines the limited transferability of joint work measurements to estimated muscle work.© 2024 The Author(s).

Still, only a few previous studies have evaluated the chronic effects of an SS intervention program in older adults, and the potential relationship between ROM changes and muscle stiffness changes is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 10- week SS intervention partially supervised program on joint range of motion (ROM) and tissue hardness in older adults.The SS intervention program was conducted at least three times a week for 10 weeks in the ankle plantar flexor muscles of 24 community-dwelling older adults (73.8 ± 5.1 years; height: 156.0 ± 6.8 cm; body mass: 52.7 ± 8.0 kg). The SS intervention program consisted of 4 × 30-s repetitions. Ankle joint dorsiflexion (DF) ROM and tissue hardness of the medial gastrocnemius were measured before and after the 10-week SS intervention program.The results showed that the 10-week SS intervention program significantly increased DF ROM (+9°, p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 1.37) and decreased tissue hardness (-0.9, p = 0.04, Cohen's d = -0.27). However, there was no significant correlation between these changes (r = 0.086, p = 0.561). The results of this study suggest that a 10-week SS intervention program can effectively increase DF ROM and decrease tissue hardness but that the increase in DF ROM is related to stretch tolerance rather than changes in tissue hardness.Copyright © 2024 Nakamura, Scardina, Thomas, Warneke and Konrad.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of arousal state and stretch speed on healthy individuals ROMmax, stiffness, gastrocnemius medialis, and soleus electromyographic activity (EMG). Fourteen participants performed one familiarization and then one testing session on separate days in the laboratory. In the familiarization (Session 1), participants practiced fast (30°/s ankle dorsiflexion) and slow (5°/s) plantar flexor stretches on an isokinetic dynamometer with the knee extended. In the experimental session (Session 2), they performed two slow, then two fast, stretches under three randomized arousal conditions: control (no music), arousing, and relaxing music. Dorsiflexion ROMmax, ankle joint stiffness, muscle activity during stretch, mean heart rate, and perception of arousal were measured. Perception of arousal was greater in the arousing than relaxing condition (p = 0.001). ROMmax was greater during fast (69.1° ± 7.8°) than slow stretches (64.9° ± 10.8°; p = 0.002) with no effect of arousal. Stiffness and EMG were higher at faster speeds, with a significantly greater percentage of stiffness observed in the arousing than the other conditions during faster stretches (p = 0.04). ROMmax was greater at the faster stretch speed despite greater stiffness and muscle activities being produced during the stretch. Thus, despite reflexive muscle activity and viscosity being higher during faster stretches, a greater, not lesser, ROMmax was observed.

          "abstract": "Although supervised exercise therapy (SET) is a primary treatment for peripheral artery disease (PAD), the current literature is limited regarding the mechanisms contributing to increased walking distances, including how lower extremity muscle function is altered after SET. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SET on lower extremity muscle function during walking in patients with PAD.Twelve patients with PAD participated in a 6-month SET program consisting of three weekly exercise sessions (a total of 72 sessions) and adhered to the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) recommendations. Each session started with a 5 min warm-up of mild walking and static stretching of upper and lower body muscles, followed by 50 min of intermitted exercise on a treadmill, and then finished with 5 min of cool-down activities similar to the warm-up. Each patient walked across a 10 m pathway with reflective markers on their lower limbs twice: before (baseline) and after six months of participation in SET (post-exercise). Marker coordinates and ground reaction forces were recorded and imported to OpenSim software (version 4.0) for gait simulations. Muscle force, muscle power, and metabolic rate were estimated from OpenSim and compared between the baseline and post-exercise.The mean plantar flexor force was not altered after SET. However, individuals' plantar flexor muscles demonstrated improvements in force production (lateral gastrocnemius: 75-80% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.43; medial gastrocnemius: 65-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.71; soleus: 90-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.26). Furthermore, plantar flexor power increased (80-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.39) and this was attributed to increased power in the lateral gastrocnemius (80-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47), medial gastrocnemius (80-90% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.22-0.60), and soleus muscles (85-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.49). Similarly, other muscle groups (knee extensors, knee flexors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip extensors, and hip flexors) also exhibited force and power increases after SET. Additionally, force and power variances were significantly decreased in several muscle groups (plantar flexors, knee extensors, hip abductors, hip external rotators, hip extensors, and hip flexors). Total metabolic rate also increased during the stance period where muscle force and power were elevated after SET (early stance: 5-25%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.82; mid stance: 35-45%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47; late stance: 75-80%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.36).Our results suggest that from a biomechanics perspective, muscle functions during walking are improved in patients with PAD after SET; however, the improvements were generally small and were not reflected by all muscle groups.",

The effects of combining radiofrequency (RF) therapy with static stretching (SS) on hamstring tightness have not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to verify the superiority of combining RF and SS over SS alone by comparing their immediate effects on hamstring flexibility.This randomized controlled study included 33 participants with hamstring tightness. The participants were allocated to the RF (intervention; n = 17) or sham (n = 16) group. The RF group underwent SS simultaneously with RF therapy. The sham group underwent SS with sham RF (powered off). The range of motion (ROM) for knee extension and five muscle properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation, and creep) of the lateral and medial hamstrings were measured before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in the ROM for knee extension (p = 0.295) between the RF and sham groups. The interaction between group and period (p > 0.05) was not significant for any of the muscle properties of the lateral and medial hamstrings besides lateral hamstring elasticity (p = 0.001).RF therapy in conjunction with SS for hamstring tightness produced different changes in muscle properties compared with SS alone.

          "abstract": "compare the acute effect of lower limb stretching exercises with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on the antagonist and agonist muscle groups in the execution of a vertical jump (VJ).a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial was conducted involving 30 male volleyball athletes. Group A engaged in PNF on the antagonist muscles, while Group B applied the same method to the agonist muscles. Following a 48-h washout period, the interventions were swapped between the respective groups. Both groups underwent assessments averaging three countermovement vertical jumps (CVJ) with hands on hips and three VJ with arms free. Measurement was taken using the Encoder - Ergonauta I, with over 1500 jumps recorded. The participants were evaluated for their level of flexibility and VJ performance using the Jump Sigma Index application.an acute decrease in average performance was identified, amounting to 3.86 % for the CMJ with hands on hips and 3.06% for the CVJ with free hands, following PNF in the agonists.there was no statistical difference between the means before and after the intervention when PNF was applied to the antagonistic hamstring muscles. The CVJ modalities with hands on hips and with free hands presented statistically similar indices. The study suggests that there is no impediment to the implementation of warm-up or training protocols that involve stretching in the antagonistic muscles.

          "abstract": "Medial gastrocnemius strain (MGS), is the most common cause of mid-calf pain in athletes due to the stretch of the gastrocnemius muscle when the knee is in extension and the ankle is in dorsiflexion. Chronological age and previous calf injury are the most substantial risk factors for MGS, including high body mass index, previous lower limb injuries, L5 radiculopathy, and inadequate warm-up. The dominant presentation of MGS is a pain that can be diverse from acute to latent, which is felt in the posteromedial aspect of the calf and is often preceded by a feeling of a pop. The signs of MGS include antalgic gait, ecchymosis, swelling, local tenderness, and sometimes a palpable gap felt along the muscle. Passive dorsiflexion of the ankle or resistive ankle plantarflexion with knee extension can indicate a more severe injury, while functional tests can illicit milder injuries of calf muscles-including gastrocnemius. The diagnosis of MGS is usually made by clinical evaluation. However, imaging modalities-including magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound-can be helpful in case of suspicion. In most cases of MGS, the cornerstone of treatment is nonoperative rehabilitation, which can be performed as a 4-phase program and should be tailored individually. Some instances of MGS are referred for early or later surgical treatment if indicated. In this article, we review the literature about various aspects of MGS, from diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, and propose a structured approach to this injury.© 2024 Iran University of Medical Sciences.",

The FAIR (flexion adduction internal rotation) test is a provocation test used to identify sciatic nerve irritation caused by this muscle. Compression and stretching exercises are usually prescribed to treat this syndrome. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of these two treatments on surface electromyography (sEMG) of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior in patients with low back pain (LBP) and DGS.Forty-five participants were allocated to three groups of stretching exercise, compression or control. In addition to 15 min of heat and 15 min of electrical nerve stimulation for pain relief, participants in the compression exercise (CE) group received self-compression exercise, those in the stretching exercise (SE) group received self-stretching exercise and those in the control group received no extra interventions. For the two intervention groups, three sets of two minutes of exercise with two minutes of rest in between were applied. The sEMG amplitude values of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles of the affected buttock side of any one group while performing the FAIR test were compared to the others. Pain and disability were assessed and the changes were compared between the two groups.After the intervention period, no group demonstrated a change in the sEMG of the gastrocnemius or tibialis anterior muscles (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the change in this variable between groups (Mean difference (95% CI) of gastrocnemius was ranged over= -4.04 to 7.72 (-19.44 to 23.14); p = 0.603); (Mean difference (95% CI) of tibialis anterior muscles was ranged from - 2.44 to -6.43 (-18.28 to 9.31); p = 0.550).; Pain and disability also decreased significantly in all three study groups (p < 0.05). However, only the disability of patients who performed stretching exercises improved compared to the compression exercise group (Mean difference (95% CI) = -12.62 (-20.41 to -4.38); p = 0.009).Neither stretching nor compression exercises altered the sEMG of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles in patients with DGS. Furthermore, performing stretching exercises improved disability compared to the other interventions.The trial was retrospectively registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ) on 10/01/2017 as IRCT201604178035N4.

However, it remains unclear if this mechanical interaction is affected by the stiffness of the structural connection. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of the knee angle on myofascial force transmission across the dorsal knee. A randomized, cross-over study was performed, including n = 56 healthy participants (25.36 ± 3.9 years, 25 females). On two separate days, they adopted a prone position on an isokinetic dynamometer (knee extended or 60° flexed). In each condition, the device moved the ankle three times from maximal plantarflexion to maximal dorsal extension. Muscle inactivity was ensured using EMG. High-resolution ultrasound videos of the semimembranosus (SM) and the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) soft tissue were recorded. Maximal horizontal tissue displacement, obtained using cross-correlation, was examined as a surrogate of force transmission. SM tissue displacement was higher at extended (4.83 ± 2.04 mm) than at flexed knees (3.81 ± 2.36 mm). Linear regression demonstrated significant associations between (1) SM and GM soft tissue displacement (extended: R2 = 0.18, p = 0.001; flexed: R2 = 0.17, p = 0.002) as well as (2) SM soft tissue displacement and ankle range of motion (extended: R2 = 0.103, p = 0.017; flexed: R2 = 0.095, p = 0.022).

          "abstract": "Introduction: If the aim is to increase maximal strength (MSt) and muscle mass, resistance training (RT) is primarily used to achieve these outcomes. However, research indicates that long-duration stretching sessions of up to 2 h per day can also provide sufficient stimuli to induce muscle growth. In RT literature, sex-related differences in adaptations are widely discussed, however, there is a lack of evidence addressing the sex-related effects on MSt and muscle thickness (MTh) of longer duration stretch training. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of 6 weeks of daily (1 h) unilateral static stretch training of the plantar flexors using a calf-muscle stretching device. Methods: Fifty-five healthy (m = 28, f = 27), active participants joined the study. MSt and range of motion (ROM) were measured with extended and flexed knee joint, and MTh was investigated in the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. Results: Statistically significant increases in MSt of 6%-15% (p < .001-.049, d = 0.45-1.09), ROM of 6%-21% (p < .001-.037, d = 0.47-1.38) and MTh of 4%-14% (p < .001-.005, d = 0.46-0.72) from pre-to post-test were observed, considering both sexes and both legs. Furthermore, there was a significant higher increase in MSt, MTh and ROM in male participants. In both groups, participants showed more pronounced adaptations in MSt and ROM with an extended knee joint as well as MTh in the medial head of the gastrocnemius (p < .001-.047). Results for relative MSt increases showed a similar result (p < .001-.036, d = 0.48-1.03). Discussion: Results are in accordance with previous studies pointing out significant increases of MSt, MTh and ROM due to long duration static stretch training. Both sexes showed significant increases in listed parameters however, male participants showed superior increases.Copyright © 2023 Warneke, Zech, Wagner, Konrad, Nakamura, Keiner, Schoenfeld and Behm.",

A recent in-vivo experiment demonstrated that passive elongation of the calf caused a caudal displacement of the semimembranosus muscle, indicating force transmission across the dorsal knee joint. However, it remains unclear as to whether this observation is dependent on the joint angle. If force would not be transmitted at flexed knees, this would reduce the number of postures and movements where force transmission is of relevance. Our trial, therefore, aims to investigate the influence of passive calf stretching with the knee in extended and flexed position on dorsal thigh soft tissue displacement.Participants are positioned prone on an isokinetic dynamometer. The device performs three repetitions of moving the ankle passively (5°/s) between plantar flexion and maximum dorsiflexion. With a washout-period of 24 hours, this procedure is performed twice in randomised order, once with the knee extended (0°) and once with the knee flexed (60°). Two high-resolution ultrasound devices will be used to visualize the soft tissue of the calf and dorsal thigh during the manoeuvre. Maximal horizontal displacement of the soft tissue [mm] during ankle movement will be quantified as a surrogate of force transmission, using a frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis of the obtained US videos.Understanding myofascial force transmission under in-vivo conditions is a pre-requisite for the development of exercise interventions specifically targeting the fascial connective tissue.

          "abstract": "Rebuilding strength capacity is of crucial importance in rehabilitation since significant atrophy due to immobilization after injury and/or surgery can be assumed. To increase maximal strength (MSt), strength training is commonly used. The literature regarding animal studies show that long-lasting static stretching (LStr) interventions can also produce significant improvements in MSt with a dose-response relationship, with stretching times ranging from 30 min to 24 h per day; however, there is limited evidence in human studies. Consequently, the aim of this study is to investigate the dose-response relationship of long-lasting static stretching on MSt. A total of 70 active participants (f = 30, m = 39; age: 27.4 ± 4.4 years; height: 175.8 ± 2.1 cm; and weight: 79.5 ± 5.9 kg) were divided into three groups: IG1 and IG2 both performed unilateral stretching continuously for one (IG1) or two hours (IG2), respectively, per day for six weeks, while the CG served as the non-intervened control. MSt was determined in the plantar flexors in the intervened as well as in the non-intervened control leg to investigate the contralateral force transfer. Two-way ANOVA showed significant interaction effects for MSt in the intervened leg (ƞ2 = 0.325, p < 0.001) and in the contralateral control leg (ƞ2 = 0.123, p = 0.009), dependent upon stretching time. From this, it can be hypothesized that stretching duration had an influence on MSt increases, but both durations were sufficient to induce significant enhancements in MSt. Thus, possible applications in rehabilitation can be assumed, e.g., if no strength training can be performed, atrophy could instead be reduced by performing long-lasting static stretch training.",

The influence of these stretch-induced changes on muscle function at submaximal forces is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the changes in neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles after a static-stretch intervention were estimated. Neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles during a low-force contraction increased after repeated static stretches. These findings suggest that adjustments in motor unit activity are necessary at low forces to accommodate reductions in the force-generating and transmission capabilities of the muscle-tendon unit after repeated static stretches of the calf muscles.Static stretching decreases stiffness about a joint, but its influence on muscle-tendon unit function and muscle activation is unclear. We investigated the influence of three static stretches on changes in neural drive to the plantar flexor muscles, both after a stretch intervention and after a set of maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Estimates of neural drive were obtained during submaximal isometric contractions by decomposing high-density electromyographic signals into the activity of individual motor units from medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius and soleus. Motor units were matched across contractions and an estimate of neural drive to the plantar flexors was calculated by normalizing the cumulative spike train to the number of active motor units (normalized neural drive). Mean discharge rate increased after the stretch intervention during the 10% MVC task for all recorded motor units and those matched across conditions (all, P = 0.0046; matched only, P = 0.002), recruitment threshold decreased for motor units matched across contractions (P = 0.022), and discharge rate at recruitment was elevated (P = 0.004). Similarly, the estimate of normalized neural drive was significantly greater after the stretch intervention at 10% MVC torque (P = 0.029), but not at 35% MVC torque. The adjustments in motor unit activity required to complete the 10% MVC task after stretch may have been partially attenuated by a set of plantar flexor MVCs.

The effects of combining radiofrequency (RF) therapy with static stretching (SS) on hamstring tightness have not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to verify the superiority of combining RF and SS over SS alone by comparing their immediate effects on hamstring flexibility.This randomized controlled study included 33 participants with hamstring tightness. The participants were allocated to the RF (intervention; n = 17) or sham (n = 16) group. The RF group underwent SS simultaneously with RF therapy. The sham group underwent SS with sham RF (powered off). The range of motion (ROM) for knee extension and five muscle properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation, and creep) of the lateral and medial hamstrings were measured before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in the ROM for knee extension (p = 0.295) between the RF and sham groups. The interaction between group and period (p > 0.05) was not significant for any of the muscle properties of the lateral and medial hamstrings besides lateral hamstring elasticity (p = 0.001).RF therapy in conjunction with SS for hamstring tightness produced different changes in muscle properties compared with SS alone. However, these changes did not produce differences in the ROM for knee extension.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Group A engaged in PNF on the antagonist muscles, while Group B applied the same method to the agonist muscles. Following a 48-h washout period, the interventions were swapped between the respective groups. Both groups underwent assessments averaging three countermovement vertical jumps (CVJ) with hands on hips and three VJ with arms free. Measurement was taken using the Encoder - Ergonauta I, with over 1500 jumps recorded. The participants were evaluated for their level of flexibility and VJ performance using the Jump Sigma Index application.an acute decrease in average performance was identified, amounting to 3.86 % for the CMJ with hands on hips and 3.06% for the CVJ with free hands, following PNF in the agonists.there was no statistical difference between the means before and after the intervention when PNF was applied to the antagonistic hamstring muscles. The CVJ modalities with hands on hips and with free hands presented statistically similar indices.

In contrast, the selective hamstring strengthening group specifically targeted lateral hamstring strengthening and medial hamstring stretching. The treatment program was conducted three times a week for 4 weeks. Pain and disability levels were evaluated before and after treatment using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), quality of life was assessed using the Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life (OAKHQOL) questionnaire, and physical activity levels were determined using the Tegner activity scale.Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in all outcomes except for the quality of life subscale of the KOOS questionnaire (p = .98) in the general hamstring strengthening group. However, the selective hamstring strengthening group exhibited greater improvements in symptoms (p = .02, effect size (d) = 0.92) and pain subscales (p = .01, d = 0.80) according to the KOOS questionnaire. Additionally, the pain subscale (p = .02, d = 0.79) of the OAKHQOL questionnaire exhibited greater improvements in the selective hamstring strengthening group. Tegner activity scale scores significantly improved in both groups.Strengthening the lateral hamstring and stretching the medial hamstring muscles seem to be beneficial for reducing pain in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis and varus deformity.

          "abstract": "Soccer teams integrate specific exercises into their typical workout programs for injury prevention. This study examined the effects of hamstring exercise on paraspinal and hamstring stiffness. These findings can inform training and rehabilitation programs to improve muscle health and prevent injuries. Fifteen young, healthy males performed passive and active (submaximal) knee flexion efforts from 0°, 45°, to 90° angle of knee flexion from the prone position. Using shear-wave elastography (SWE) and surface electromyography, we measured the elastic modulus and root mean square (RMS) signal of the erector spinae (ES), multifidus (MF), semitendinosus (ST), and semimembranosus (SM) during different knee flexion angles. Passive SWE modulus at 0° was 12.44 ± 4.45 kPa (ES), 13.35 ± 6.12 kPa (MF), 22.01 ± 4.68 kPa (ST), and 21.57 ± 5.22 kPa (SM) and it was greater (p 0.05). Compared to rest, the relative increase in the SWE modulus during active contraction had a median value (interquartile range) ranging from 68.11 (86.29) to 101.69 (54.33)% for the paraspinal muscles and it was moderately to strongly correlated (r > 0.672) with the corresponding increase of the hamstring muscles [ranging from 225.94 (114.72) to 463.16 (185.16)%]. The RMS signal was greater during active compared to passive conditions, and it was lower at 90° compared to 45° (for SM/ST) and 0° (for all muscles). The association between paraspinal and hamstring passive muscle stiffness indicates a potential transmission of forces through myofascial connections between the lumbar spine and the lower limbs. In this laboratory setting, hamstring exercises affected the stiffness of the paraspinal muscles.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(11): 1860-1866, 2024-Hamstring strain injuries occur when localized tissue strain capacity is exceeded. Localized strain may be affected by intramuscular variation in stiffness, but research in this area is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of intramuscular hamstring stiffness on localized muscle strain during passive hip flexion. Twenty-eight (age 25.0 ± 4.9 years) healthy women ( n = 15) and men ( n = 13) had biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus stiffness measured proximally, medially, and distally during passive hip flexion and extension using shear-wave elastography. Anthropometric and stiffness measurements were entered into an anatomical model of equivalent springs to estimate localized tissue strain and differentiate between the relative contribution to passive strain from each muscular region. In shortened and stretched positions, stiffness was lowest proximally for all muscles (Cohen's d = 0.66-0.79, p < 0.001). In addition, relative strain contribution was greater proximally (37.5-39.4%) compared with middle (31.74-32.2%) or distal (28.6-30.3%) regions ( p < 0.001), with proximal contribution to strain increasing with greater hip flexion. Our results suggest that intramuscular variations in passive hamstring stiffness contribute to inhomogeneous strain throughout the muscle during passive hip flexion.

          "abstract": "Previous training studies with comprehensive stretching durations have reported that an increase in range of motion (ROM) can be related to decreases in muscle stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the passive muscle stiffness of three muscle groups (triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings) to the respective joint ROM. Thirty-six healthy male soccer players volunteered in this study. After a standardized warm-up, the muscle stiffness was tested via shear wave elastography in six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris long head). The hip extension, hip flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM were also assessed with a modified Thomas test, a sit and reach test, and a standing wall push test, respectively. We found significant moderate to large correlations between hip flexion ROM and muscle stiffness for the semimembranosus (rP = -0.43; P = 0.01), biceps femoris long head (rP = -0.45; P = 0.01), and overall hamstring stiffness (rP = -0.50; P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found for triceps surae (rP = -0.12; P = 0.51 to 0.67) and rectus femoris muscle stiffness (rP = 0.25; P = 0.14) with ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension ROM, respectively. We conclude that muscle stiffness is an important contributor to hip flexion ROM, but less important for hip extension or ankle joint ROM. Additional contributors to ROM might be tendon stiffness or stretch/pain tolerance.Copyright © Biology of Sport 2024.",

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "title": "A Velocity Stretch Reflex Threshold Based on Muscle-Tendon Unit Peak Acceleration to Detect Possible Occurrences of Spasticity during Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",
          "abstract": "Spasticity might affect gait in children with cerebral palsy. Quantifying its occurrence during locomotion is challenging. One approach is to determine kinematic stretch reflex thresholds, usually on the velocity, during passive assessment and to search for their exceedance during gait. These thresholds are determined through EMG-Onset detection algorithms, which are variable in performance and sensitive to noisy data, and can therefore lack consistency. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of determining the velocity stretch reflex threshold from maximal musculotendon acceleration. Eighteen children with CP were recruited and underwent clinical gait analysis and a full instrumented assessment of their soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, semitendinosus, and rectus femoris spasticity, with EMG, kinematics, and applied forces being measured simultaneously. Using a subject-scaled musculoskeletal model, the acceleration-based stretch reflex velocity thresholds were determined and compared to those based on EMG-Onset determination. Their consistencies according to physiological criteria, i.e., if the timing of the threshold was between the beginning of the stretch and the spastic catch, were evaluated. Finally, two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait, i.e., the proportion of the gait trial time with a gait velocity above the velocity threshold and the number of times the threshold was exceeded, were compared. The proposed method produces velocity stretch reflex thresholds close to the EMG-based ones. For all muscles, no statistical difference was found between the two parameters designed to evaluate the occurrence of spasticity during gait. Contrarily to the EMG-based methods, the proposed method always provides physiologically consistent values, with median electromechanical delays of between 50 and 130 ms. For all subjects, the semitendinosus velocity during gait usually exceeded its stretch reflex threshold, while it was less frequent for the three other muscles. We conclude that a velocity stretch reflex threshold, based on musculotendon acceleration, is a reliable substitute for EMG-based ones.",

The study had a within-participant experimental design. Sixteen healthy male college sprinters were asked to sprint 80 m without static stretching and with static stretching of the hamstrings for 4 × 30 s per leg before the sprint; both conditions were counterbalanced. The knee flexion peak torque was measured using the Nordic hamstring. The differences between no static stretching and static stretching as well as their relationship with Nordic hamstring strength were investigated. The results showed that the touchdown distance (p = .036) significantly increased following static stretching. Although not significant, maximal sprint speed decreased (p = .086), and the theoretical hamstring length (difference between knee angle and hip angle) at ipsilateral touchdown was greater (p = .069) following static stretching. In addition, a lower peak torque of the Nordic hamstring resulted in a more significant decrease in maximal sprint speed following static stretching. Therefore, static stretching of the hamstring just before sprinting may increase the theoretical hamstring length during the late swing phase at maximal sprint speed and induce kinematics that increases the hamstring strain injury risk. Moreover, it is suggested that improving the Nordic hamstring strength may help minimize the negative effects of static stretching on the hamstrings.",

          "abstract": "Strengthening the rotator cuff muscles is important for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Since muscle fascicle length improves motor performance and is suggested to reduce the risk of injury for the hamstring, it may be an important variable to promote multidirectional changes in the function and macroscopic structure for the shoulder. Recent literature reviews overwhelmingly suggest that eccentric exercises improve fascicle length and functional measures for the lower limb. However, there is a research gap for the shoulder. Since ultrasound imaging is the most commonly used imaging technique to quantify muscle structure, but has yielded heterogeneous results in different studies, there is another issue and a research gap for the imaging method. Based on the research gaps, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of standardized eccentric strength training on the function and structure of the external rotator cuff muscles using an isokinetic dynamometer and MRI. Therefore, a preliminary pre-post intervention study was conducted and 16 physically active men were recruited in October 2021. For the right shoulder, an eccentric isokinetic training was performed twice a week for almost six weeks. The primary outcome measures (external rotators) were active and passive range of motion, eccentric and concentric torque at 30, 60, and 180°/s isokinetic speed, and fascicle length and fascicle volume for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The findings show a training effect for the absolute mean values of eccentric strength (+24%, p = .008). The torque-angle relationship increased, especially in the final phase of range of motion, although a 4% (p = .002) decrease in passive range of motion was found in the stretch test. Positive changes in muscle structure were shown for the supraspinatus muscle fascicle length (+16%, p = .003) and fascicle volume (+19%, p = .002). Based on the study results, we can conclude that eccentric isokinetic training has a significant positive effect on the shoulder. To our knowledge, this is the first eccentric training study using both isokinetic dynamometer and muscle diffusion tensor imaging to access functional and structural changes in the human shoulder rotator cuff muscles. The methods were shown to be applicable for interventional studies. Based on these results, populations such as high-performance handball players with highly trained shoulders should be included in future studies.Copyright: © 2023 Vetter et al.

A 30-minute session was given to each patient three times per week and was given for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity, the active knee extension test (AKET) for hamstring flexibility, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) for the health status of KOA patients.The study found a significant interaction (p < 0.001) between interventions and time across several measurements.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the acute effects of static stretching (SS) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching on hamstrings flexibility and shear modulus. Sixteen recreationally active young volunteers participated in a randomized cross-over study. Participants underwent an aerobic warm-up (WU), followed by either SS or PNF stretching. Range of motion (RoM) during passive straight leg raise and active knee extension, as well as shear modulus of the biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles, were measured at baseline, post-WU, and post-stretching. Both stretching techniques significantly increased RoM, with no differences observed between SS and PNF (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.59-0.68). However, only PNF stretching resulted in a significant decrease in BF shear modulus (time×stretching type interaction: p = 0.045; η2 = 0.19), indicating reduced muscle stiffness. No changes in ST shear modulus were observed after either stretching technique. There was no significant correlation between changes in RoM and shear modulus, suggesting that the increase in RoM was predominantly due to changes in stretch tolerance rather than mechanical properties of the muscles. These findings suggest that both SS and PNF stretching can effectively improve hamstring flexibility, but PNF stretching may additionally reduce BF muscle stiffness.

The effects of combining radiofrequency (RF) therapy with static stretching (SS) on hamstring tightness have not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to verify the superiority of combining RF and SS over SS alone by comparing their immediate effects on hamstring flexibility.This randomized controlled study included 33 participants with hamstring tightness. The participants were allocated to the RF (intervention; n = 17) or sham (n = 16) group. The RF group underwent SS simultaneously with RF therapy. The sham group underwent SS with sham RF (powered off). The range of motion (ROM) for knee extension and five muscle properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation, and creep) of the lateral and medial hamstrings were measured before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in the ROM for knee extension (p = 0.295) between the RF and sham groups. The interaction between group and period (p > 0.05) was not significant for any of the muscle properties of the lateral and medial hamstrings besides lateral hamstring elasticity (p = 0.001).RF therapy in conjunction with SS for hamstring tightness produced different changes in muscle properties compared with SS alone.

This study examined the effects of hamstring exercise on paraspinal and hamstring stiffness. These findings can inform training and rehabilitation programs to improve muscle health and prevent injuries. Fifteen young, healthy males performed passive and active (submaximal) knee flexion efforts from 0°, 45°, to 90° angle of knee flexion from the prone position. Using shear-wave elastography (SWE) and surface electromyography, we measured the elastic modulus and root mean square (RMS) signal of the erector spinae (ES), multifidus (MF), semitendinosus (ST), and semimembranosus (SM) during different knee flexion angles. Passive SWE modulus at 0° was 12.44 ± 4.45 kPa (ES), 13.35 ± 6.12 kPa (MF), 22.01 ± 4.68 kPa (ST), and 21.57 ± 5.22 kPa (SM) and it was greater (p 0.05). Compared to rest, the relative increase in the SWE modulus during active contraction had a median value (interquartile range) ranging from 68.11 (86.29) to 101.69 (54.33)% for the paraspinal muscles and it was moderately to strongly correlated (r > 0.672) with the corresponding increase of the hamstring muscles [ranging from 225.94 (114.72) to 463.16 (185.16)%]. The RMS signal was greater during active compared to passive conditions, and it was lower at 90° compared to 45° (for SM/ST) and 0° (for all muscles). The association between paraspinal and hamstring passive muscle stiffness indicates a potential transmission of forces through myofascial connections between the lumbar spine and the lower limbs. In this laboratory setting, hamstring exercises affected the stiffness of the paraspinal muscles.",

J Strength Cond Res 38(11): 1860-1866, 2024-Hamstring strain injuries occur when localized tissue strain capacity is exceeded. Localized strain may be affected by intramuscular variation in stiffness, but research in this area is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of intramuscular hamstring stiffness on localized muscle strain during passive hip flexion. Twenty-eight (age 25.0 ± 4.9 years) healthy women ( n = 15) and men ( n = 13) had biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus stiffness measured proximally, medially, and distally during passive hip flexion and extension using shear-wave elastography. Anthropometric and stiffness measurements were entered into an anatomical model of equivalent springs to estimate localized tissue strain and differentiate between the relative contribution to passive strain from each muscular region. In shortened and stretched positions, stiffness was lowest proximally for all muscles (Cohen's d = 0.66-0.79, p < 0.001). In addition, relative strain contribution was greater proximally (37.5-39.4%) compared with middle (31.74-32.2%) or distal (28.6-30.3%) regions ( p < 0.001), with proximal contribution to strain increasing with greater hip flexion. Our results suggest that intramuscular variations in passive hamstring stiffness contribute to inhomogeneous strain throughout the muscle during passive hip flexion.

          "abstract": "Most athletes experience short-term training cessation because of illness, injury, post-season vacation, or other reasons. Passive muscle stiffness is a potential risk factor for a sprint-type hamstring strain injury, but limited information is available about the effect of short-term training cessation on passive muscle stiffness. The present study aimed to identify whether and how passive muscle stiffness of the biceps femoris long head (BFlh) would vary due to 2 weeks of training cessation in sprinters.Passive BFlh shear-wave speed (a proxy for stiffness) was measured using ultrasound shear-wave elastography in 28 male sprinters, before and after 2 weeks of intervention. During the 2 weeks, the participants in the training-cessation group (n = 14) were allowed to maintain their normal daily activities but not to perform any physical training, including stretching and resistance exercises. The participants in the training continuation group (n = 14) performed the training (including maximum speed sprint, plyometric, and weight training) prescribed by their coaches 5 days per week.In the training-cessation group, passive BFlh shear-wave speed increased after the 2 weeks of training cessation (4.75 ± 0.77 to 5.00 ± 0.88 m/s, P < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference before and after the 2 weeks of training continuation (4.90 ± 0.85 to 4.93 ± 0.85 m/s, P = 0.521).The present findings indicate that muscles stiffen by training cessation in sprinting athletes.© 2024.

However, a stretching method that can both decrease muscle-tendon unit (MTU) stiffness and increase muscle strength has not been developed. The purpose of this study was to examine the combined effects of 30 seconds of static stretching at different intensities (normal-intensity static stretching [NS] and high-intensity static [HS]) and dynamic stretching at different speeds (low-speed dynamic [LD] and high-speed dynamic stretching [HD]) on the MTU stiffness and muscle strength of the hamstrings. Thirteen healthy subjects (9 men and 4 women, 20.9 ± 0.8 years, 169.3 ± 7.2 cm, 61.1 ± 8.2 kg) performed 4 types of interventions (HS-HD, HS-LD, NS-HD, and NS-LD). Range of motion (ROM), passive torque, MTU stiffness, and muscle strength were measured before and immediately after interventions by using an isokinetic dynamometer machine. In all interventions, the ROM and passive torque significantly increased (p < 0.01). Muscle-tendon unit stiffness significantly decreased in HS-HD and HS-LD (both p < 0.01), but there was no significant change in NS-HD (p = 0.30) or NS-LD (p = 0.42). Muscle strength significantly increased after HS-HD (p = 0.02) and NS-LD (p = 0.03), but there was no significant change in HS-LD (p = 0.23) or NS-LD (p = 0.26).

          "abstract": "Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is induced by pathological knee conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of tactile stimulation on reflex changes induced by simulated AMI during unpredictable landing performances. Twenty participants performed six unilateral landing tasks: 15 cm normal landing (15NL), 30 cm normal landing (30NL), surprise landing (SL), 30 cm normal landing following vibration (30NLV), SL following vibration (SLV), and SL following vibration with Kinesiology tape (SLK). For SL, the solid landing platform (15 cm) was removed and replaced by a false floor. Since the false floor dislodged easily under load, participants unpredictably fell through the platform to the actual landing surface 15 cm below. After completing 15NL, 30NL, and SL, vibration was applied to participants' knees to induce neurological changes similar to AMI. After vibration, participants performed 30NLV, SLV, and SLK in a random order. EMG signals in the post-landing short latency (31-60 ms) and medium latency (61-90 ms) periods were examined. EMG signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and biceps femoris (BF) were recorded and compared between tasks. EMG signals of all muscles in SL were significantly enhanced in the medium latency period as compared with 30NL. Enhanced EMG signals in SL were suppressed by vibration stimulation in the VL, but the suppressed EMG signals were restored after cutaneous stimulation with Kinesiology tape (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMI could alter motor control patterns during unpredictable landing and that tactile stimulation could restore the altered motor control to a normal state.Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science In Sports© 2024 The Authors.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the acute effects of static stretching of the hamstrings on maximal sprint speed and its spatiotemporal variables and lower-limb kinematics during the late swing phase, as well as the relationship with Nordic hamstring strength. The study had a within-participant experimental design. Sixteen healthy male college sprinters were asked to sprint 80 m without static stretching and with static stretching of the hamstrings for 4 × 30 s per leg before the sprint; both conditions were counterbalanced. The knee flexion peak torque was measured using the Nordic hamstring. The differences between no static stretching and static stretching as well as their relationship with Nordic hamstring strength were investigated. The results showed that the touchdown distance (p = .036) significantly increased following static stretching. Although not significant, maximal sprint speed decreased (p = .086), and the theoretical hamstring length (difference between knee angle and hip angle) at ipsilateral touchdown was greater (p = .069) following static stretching. In addition, a lower peak torque of the Nordic hamstring resulted in a more significant decrease in maximal sprint speed following static stretching. Therefore, static stretching of the hamstring just before sprinting may increase the theoretical hamstring length during the late swing phase at maximal sprint speed and induce kinematics that increases the hamstring strain injury risk. Moreover, it is suggested that improving the Nordic hamstring strength may help minimize the negative effects of static stretching on the hamstrings.",

          "abstract": "Strengthening the rotator cuff muscles is important for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Since muscle fascicle length improves motor performance and is suggested to reduce the risk of injury for the hamstring, it may be an important variable to promote multidirectional changes in the function and macroscopic structure for the shoulder. Recent literature reviews overwhelmingly suggest that eccentric exercises improve fascicle length and functional measures for the lower limb. However, there is a research gap for the shoulder. Since ultrasound imaging is the most commonly used imaging technique to quantify muscle structure, but has yielded heterogeneous results in different studies, there is another issue and a research gap for the imaging method. Based on the research gaps, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of standardized eccentric strength training on the function and structure of the external rotator cuff muscles using an isokinetic dynamometer and MRI. Therefore, a preliminary pre-post intervention study was conducted and 16 physically active men were recruited in October 2021. For the right shoulder, an eccentric isokinetic training was performed twice a week for almost six weeks. The primary outcome measures (external rotators) were active and passive range of motion, eccentric and concentric torque at 30, 60, and 180°/s isokinetic speed, and fascicle length and fascicle volume for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The findings show a training effect for the absolute mean values of eccentric strength (+24%, p = .008). The torque-angle relationship increased, especially in the final phase of range of motion, although a 4% (p = .002) decrease in passive range of motion was found in the stretch test. Positive changes in muscle structure were shown for the supraspinatus muscle fascicle length (+16%, p = .003) and fascicle volume (+19%, p = .002). Based on the study results, we can conclude that eccentric isokinetic training has a significant positive effect on the shoulder. To our knowledge, this is the first eccentric training study using both isokinetic dynamometer and muscle diffusion tensor imaging to access functional and structural changes in the human shoulder rotator cuff muscles. The methods were shown to be applicable for interventional studies. Based on these results, populations such as high-performance handball players with highly trained shoulders should be included in future studies.Copyright: © 2023 Vetter et al.

In group A, the therapist made 30 strokes gentle strokes with the tool from the origin to the insertion while holding the plane at a 45-degree angle over the treatment area. In group B, PNF stretching was done with three repetitions and 10 seconds rest between each, after isometric contraction of the hamstring muscle using approximately 50% of their maximum strength, holding it for 8 seconds, and then releasing it. A 30-minute session was given to each patient three times per week and was given for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity, the active knee extension test (AKET) for hamstring flexibility, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) for the health status of KOA patients.The study found a significant interaction (p < 0.001) between interventions and time across several measurements. After 6 weeks, both interventions resulted in significant improvements (p < 0.001) across all dependent variables, with group A (IASTM) showing more significant improvement in hamstring flexibility, pain reduction, and health status (p < 0.001) compared to group B (PNF).Both the IASTM technique and PNF stretching resulted in increased hamstring flexibility, decreased pain, and enhanced general health. The IASTM technique, however, showed potential benefits over PNF stretching in terms of flexibility, pain relief, and public health enhancement.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the acute effects of static stretching (SS) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching on hamstrings flexibility and shear modulus. Sixteen recreationally active young volunteers participated in a randomized cross-over study. Participants underwent an aerobic warm-up (WU), followed by either SS or PNF stretching. Range of motion (RoM) during passive straight leg raise and active knee extension, as well as shear modulus of the biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles, were measured at baseline, post-WU, and post-stretching. Both stretching techniques significantly increased RoM, with no differences observed between SS and PNF (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.59-0.68). However, only PNF stretching resulted in a significant decrease in BF shear modulus (time×stretching type interaction: p = 0.045; η2 = 0.19), indicating reduced muscle stiffness. No changes in ST shear modulus were observed after either stretching technique. There was no significant correlation between changes in RoM and shear modulus, suggesting that the increase in RoM was predominantly due to changes in stretch tolerance rather than mechanical properties of the muscles. These findings suggest that both SS and PNF stretching can effectively improve hamstring flexibility, but PNF stretching may additionally reduce BF muscle stiffness.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the severity of adhesion between muscles in the shoulder joint using dynamic ultrasonography and to confirm whether adhesions cause range of motion (ROM) restrictions.Twenty-four shoulders from 15 frozen shoulder patients and 24 shoulders from 18 rotator cuff disorder patients were enrolled. We obtained ultrasound video sequences of the subscapularis (SSC) and deltoid muscles during shoulder external rotation. The mean stretching velocities of the deltoid and SSC were subsequently analyzed using a personal computer. If adhesions occurred between both muscles, the deltoid was stretched more vigorously, and we calculated mean stretching velocity of the deltoid / SSC as adhesion severity. The coracohumeral ligament thickness was measured using the same images. Shoulder ROM was measured by using a universal goniometer.The intraclass correlation coefficients (1.1) and (2.1) of the adhesion severity measurements were 0.85 and 0.91, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the adhesion severity is a significant predictor for external rotation ROM in the rotator cuff disorder group (R2 = 0.44, F = 10.1, P < .01, t = -2.9), while coracohumeral ligament thickness predicts ROM in the frozen shoulder group (R2 = 0.28, F = 5.5, P = .01, t = -3.0).The proposed method is reliable. Muscle adhesion causes ROM restriction of the shoulder joint. The primary cause of shoulder ROM restriction differed between the diagnostic groups.© 2024 The Author(s).",

Individuals will be randomized into two exercise groups: isometric or isotonic. The following outcomes will be evaluated before and after the first session and after six weeks of intervention: shoulder pain and functioning; isometric strength of shoulder elevation and lateral and medial rotation; and electromyographic activity of medial deltoid, infraspinatus, serratus anterior, and lower trapezius. Groups will perform stretching and strengthening of periscapular muscles. The isometric group will perform three sets of 32 s, at 70% of maximal isometric strength. The isotonic group will perform concentric and eccentric exercises (2 s for each phase) in three sets of eight repetitions at a load of eight repetition maximum. The total time under tension of 96 s will be equal for both groups, and load will be adjusted in weeks three and five of the protocol.

Forty-nine patients who had undergone postmastectomy breast reconstruction, 17 who had undergone chemoradiation, and 18 healthy, age-matched controls were enrolled. Muscle activity was recorded from the clavicular and sternocostal regions of the pectoralis major and anterior, middle, and posterior deltoids during vertical ab/adduction or horizontal flex/extension perturbations while participants maintained minimal torques. SLR and LLR were quantified for each muscle. Our major finding was that following postmastectomy breast reconstruction, SLR and LLR are impaired in the clavicular region of the pectoralis major. Individuals who had chemoradiation had impaired stretch reflexes in the clavicular and sternocostal region of the pectoralis major, anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid.

          "abstract": "Reduction in isometric strength of the scapulohumeral muscles is a commonly seen impairment in overhead athletes afflicted with shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two different treatment programs: progressive resistance exercises plus manual therapy (PRE plus MT) and motor control exercises (MCE), on isometric strength of upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MTr), lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA), supraspinatus (Supr.), anterior deltoid (A.D), and latissimus dorsi (LD). 80 male university-level overhead athletes clinically diagnosed with SIS were randomly allocated into either of the two groups: PRE plus MT and MCE group. Athletes in the PRE plus MT group underwent graduated exercises with resistance elastic band, stretching exercises, and mobilization of the thoracic and shoulder joints. MCE group was submitted to motor control exercises in varied planar positions. Athletes in both groups underwent management 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Isometric strength of UT, MTr, LT, Supr, A.D, SA, and LD was measured at three-time points: baseline, 4th week, and 8th week. Relative to baseline, both interventions were found to be effective in increasing and optimizing the isometric strength of muscles (p 0.05). However, athletes in PRE plus MT group presented a more pronounced increase in isometric strength than those in the MCE group. Between groups analysis found the largest isometric strength improvement in PRE plus MT group for A.D, followed by Supr. and UT muscles (p < 0.05; effect size: 0.39 to 0.40). The study concluded that compared to MCE, PRE plus MT provides greater improvement in the isometric strength of scapulohumeral muscles.Copyright © 2021 Saurabh Sharma et al.",

          "abstract": "Rotator-cuff injury (RCI) is common and painful; even after surgery, joint stability and function may not recover. Relative contributions to atrophy from disuse, fibrosis, denervation, and satellite-cell responsiveness to activating stimuli are not known.Potential contributions of denervation and disrupted satellite cell responses to growth signals were examined in supraspinatus (SS) and control (ipsilateral deltoid) muscles biopsied from participants with RCI (N = 27). Biopsies were prepared for explant culture (to study satellite cell activity), immunostained to localize Pax7, BrdU, and Semaphorin 3A in satellite cells, sectioning to study blood vessel density, and western blotting to measure the fetal (γ) subunit of acetylcholine receptor (γ-AchR). Principal component analysis (PCA) for 35 parameters extracted components identified variables that contributed most to variability in the dataset. γ-AchR was higher in SS than control, indicating denervation. Satellite cells in SS had a low baseline level of activity (Pax7+ cells labelled in S-phase) versus control; only satellite cells in SS showed increased proliferative activity after nitric oxide-donor treatment. Interestingly, satellite cell localization of Semaphorin 3A, a neuro-chemorepellent, was greater in SS (consistent with fiber denervation) than control muscle at baseline. PCAs extracted components including fiber atrophy, satellite cell activity, fibrosis, atrogin-1, smoking status, vascular density, γAchR, and the time between symptoms and surgery. Use of deltoid as a control for SS was supported by PCA findings since \"muscle\" was not extracted as a variable in the first two principal components. SS muscle in RCI is therefore atrophic, denervated, and fibrotic, and has satellite cells that respond to activating stimuli.Since SS satellite cells can be activated in culture, a NO-donor drug combined with stretching could promote muscle growth and improve functional outcome after RCI. PCAs suggest indices including satellite cell responsiveness, atrogin-1, atrophy, and innervation may predict surgical outcome.",

We investigated the effect and predictors of effectiveness of massage in the treatment of patients with posterior shoulder tightness.A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a hospital-based outpatient practice (orthopedic and rehabilitation). Forty-three women and 17 men (mean age = 54 years, range 43-73 years) with posterior shoulder tightness participated and were randomized into massage and control groups (n = 30 per group). A physical therapist provided the massage on the posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, and teres minor of the involved shoulder for 18 minutes [about 6 minutes for each muscle] two times a week for 4 weeks. For the control group, one therapist applied light hand touch on the muscles 10 minutes two times a week for 4 weeks. Glenohumeral internal rotation ROM, functional status, and muscle tightness were the main outcomes. Additionally, the potential factors on the effectiveness of massage were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. For this analysis, patients with functional score improvement at least 20% after massage were considered responsive, and the others were considered nonresponsive.Fifty-two patients completed the study (29 for the massage and 23 for the control). The overall mean internal rotation ROM increased significantly in the massage group compared to the control (54.9° v.s. 34.9°; P ≤ 0.001). There were 21 patients in the responsive group and 8 in the nonresponsive group. Among the factors, duration of symptoms, functional score, and posterior deltoid tightness were significant predictors of effectiveness of massage.Massage was an effective treatment for patients with posterior shoulder tightness, but was less effective in patients with longer duration of symptoms, higher functional limitation, and less posterior deltoid tightness.This clinical trial is registered at Trial Registration \"Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01022827\".",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the severity of adhesion between muscles in the shoulder joint using dynamic ultrasonography and to confirm whether adhesions cause range of motion (ROM) restrictions.Twenty-four shoulders from 15 frozen shoulder patients and 24 shoulders from 18 rotator cuff disorder patients were enrolled. We obtained ultrasound video sequences of the subscapularis (SSC) and deltoid muscles during shoulder external rotation. The mean stretching velocities of the deltoid and SSC were subsequently analyzed using a personal computer. If adhesions occurred between both muscles, the deltoid was stretched more vigorously, and we calculated mean stretching velocity of the deltoid / SSC as adhesion severity. The coracohumeral ligament thickness was measured using the same images. Shoulder ROM was measured by using a universal goniometer.The intraclass correlation coefficients (1.1) and (2.1) of the adhesion severity measurements were 0.85 and 0.91, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the adhesion severity is a significant predictor for external rotation ROM in the rotator cuff disorder group (R2 = 0.44, F = 10.1, P < .01, t = -2.9), while coracohumeral ligament thickness predicts ROM in the frozen shoulder group (R2 = 0.28, F = 5.5, P = .01, t = -3.0).The proposed method is reliable. Muscle adhesion causes ROM restriction of the shoulder joint. The primary cause of shoulder ROM restriction differed between the diagnostic groups.© 2024 The Author(s).",

Forty-nine patients who had undergone postmastectomy breast reconstruction, 17 who had undergone chemoradiation, and 18 healthy, age-matched controls were enrolled. Muscle activity was recorded from the clavicular and sternocostal regions of the pectoralis major and anterior, middle, and posterior deltoids during vertical ab/adduction or horizontal flex/extension perturbations while participants maintained minimal torques.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two different treatment programs: progressive resistance exercises plus manual therapy (PRE plus MT) and motor control exercises (MCE), on isometric strength of upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MTr), lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA), supraspinatus (Supr.), anterior deltoid (A.D), and latissimus dorsi (LD). 80 male university-level overhead athletes clinically diagnosed with SIS were randomly allocated into either of the two groups: PRE plus MT and MCE group. Athletes in the PRE plus MT group underwent graduated exercises with resistance elastic band, stretching exercises, and mobilization of the thoracic and shoulder joints. MCE group was submitted to motor control exercises in varied planar positions. Athletes in both groups underwent management 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Isometric strength of UT, MTr, LT, Supr, A.D, SA, and LD was measured at three-time points: baseline, 4th week, and 8th week. Relative to baseline, both interventions were found to be effective in increasing and optimizing the isometric strength of muscles (p 0.05). However, athletes in PRE plus MT group presented a more pronounced increase in isometric strength than those in the MCE group.

          "abstract": "Clinical approaches like mobilization, stretching, and/or massage may decrease shoulder tightness and improve symptoms in subjects with stiff shoulders. We investigated the effect and predictors of effectiveness of massage in the treatment of patients with posterior shoulder tightness.A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a hospital-based outpatient practice (orthopedic and rehabilitation). Forty-three women and 17 men (mean age = 54 years, range 43-73 years) with posterior shoulder tightness participated and were randomized into massage and control groups (n = 30 per group). A physical therapist provided the massage on the posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, and teres minor of the involved shoulder for 18 minutes [about 6 minutes for each muscle] two times a week for 4 weeks. For the control group, one therapist applied light hand touch on the muscles 10 minutes two times a week for 4 weeks. Glenohumeral internal rotation ROM, functional status, and muscle tightness were the main outcomes. Additionally, the potential factors on the effectiveness of massage were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. For this analysis, patients with functional score improvement at least 20% after massage were considered responsive, and the others were considered nonresponsive.Fifty-two patients completed the study (29 for the massage and 23 for the control). The overall mean internal rotation ROM increased significantly in the massage group compared to the control (54.9° v.s. 34.9°; P ≤ 0.001). There were 21 patients in the responsive group and 8 in the nonresponsive group. Among the factors, duration of symptoms, functional score, and posterior deltoid tightness were significant predictors of effectiveness of massage.Massage was an effective treatment for patients with posterior shoulder tightness, but was less effective in patients with longer duration of symptoms, higher functional limitation, and less posterior deltoid tightness.This clinical trial is registered at Trial Registration \"Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01022827\".",

          "abstract": "The maximal torque effect of the middle portion of action of the deltoid muscle while raising an out-stretched upper limb was measured from left and right sides of normal untrained young adults and of the same age elite athletes. Seventeen strongly right-handed untrained males and females and 10 elite tennis players were tested. All participants were required to raise (abduct) one arm (right and then left, or vice versa) as fast as possible with maximal amplitude while standing on an electronic platform scale which measured to 0.001 kg. An assumed force at the centre of mass of the entire upper limb was considered. The force consisted of two components, namely static weight force of the upper limb and a dynamic force component created by upward acceleration of the limb. Using regression equations and scaling methods the static weight of the upper limb was derived and combined with the dynamic component to produce the total force, applied to the centre of mass of the limb. The total force multiplied by the distance from the centre of mass to point of rotation of the limb equated to the torque produced by deltoid muscle. Using video system analyses the angle of abduction was measured for each individual exercise. The additional anthropometrical tests identified proportionality and body mass indices for each participant. There was no significant difference in dynamic force and torque between left and right limb from the three groups. Sportsmen demonstrated greater lateral abduction when performing the exercise from the dominant side of the body. Sportsmen also demonstrated greater range of abduction, bigger dynamic force and torque on both sides in comparison to untrained adults. Remarkably, the absolute and relative length of arms of athletes were shorter in comparison to untrained males, but the radius of gyration from the stretched upper limb (from its centre of gravity to the shoulder joint) were greater. This phenomenon may be due to distal shifting of the gravity center of the entire upper limb in elite athletes, perhaps, because greater investment of the distal portion of the limb with skeletal muscle tissue.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine cases of patients with impingement syndrome secondary to an unfused, unstable, os acromiale.Retrospective case series.Twelve consecutive patients (13 shoulders) presented with impingement symptoms in the presence of an os acromiale. The os acromiale, at the meso-acromion level, was seen on standard radiographs. The patients were all treated conservatively with rotator cuff strengthening, stretching, anti-inflammatory medications, and steroid injections. All patients underwent an impingement test with lidocaine, resulting in complete relief of their pain. After failure of the conservative management, the 12 patients (13 shoulders) underwent an extended arthroscopic subacromial decompression. The goal of the modified arthroscopic acromioplasty was resection of adequate bone to remove the mobile anterior acromial tip. In general, this consisted of more bony resection than the typical arthroscopic acromioplasty. Postoperatively, the patients began a rehabilitation program emphasizing early range of motion followed by isolated free-weight rotator cuff strengthening exercises. Five shoulders had a partial-thickness tear of the rotator cuff. Four involved less than 50% of the thickness of the rotator cuff. These 4 partial-thickness tears underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement. One partial-thickness tear was greater than 50% and repair was performed with a mini-open deltoid-splitting technique.Results were evaluated using UCLA shoulder scoring. Preoperatively, the score averaged 17. The 3-month postoperative score was 27, and at 6 and 12 months, averaged 28. The final follow-up score averaged 31. There were 11 satisfactory results with UCLA scores >/=28. Two unsatisfactory results showed UCLA scores in the fair category. Full strength of the anterior deltoid and rotator cuff muscles was achieved in all patients by 6 months postoperatively as evaluated by manual muscle testing. Twelve of the 13 shoulders were rated by the patients as having a satisfactory result. All of the patients rated their cosmetic results as acceptable. There was no evidence of postoperative deltoid detachment. No patient developed pain at the pseudarthrosis point.Given the previously reported poor results with attempts at fusion of an unstable os acromiale and open complete excision of meso-acromial fragments, the authors conclude that an extended arthroscopic subacromial decompression results in a reasonable outcome for patients with impingement syndromes secondary to an unstable os acromiale.",

Pain was located laterally to the greater tuberculum (n = 8), at the origin of the deltoid muscle (n = 3), at the bicipital groove (n = 2) or in the area of the ventral glenoid (n = 2). Pain was caused by active anteversion above 160 degrees (n = 3), active abduction above 140 degrees (n = 2) or both (n = 10). The playing shoulder was depressed in all 30 volleyball attackers. By measuring the distance from the epicondylus radii to the acromion of the other side by maximal forced horizontal adduction, the distance from the margo medialis scapula to the spine, the distance from the tip of middle finger to the lumbar spine by maximal internal rotation of the shoulder up the back showed significant differences between both sides and between the groups. The spiking arm scapula is significantly lateralised compared to the opposite side and compared to sportsmen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Twenty-six recent hemiplegic stroke patients with shoulder muscle flaccidity were randomly assigned to either a control group (n = 13; 5 female, and 8 male) or experimental group (n = 13; 6 female, and 7 male). Both groups received conventional physical therapy. The experimental group received additional FES therapy where two flaccid/paralyzed shoulder muscles (supraspinatus and posterior deltoid) were induced to contract repetitively up to 6 hours a day for 6 weeks. Duration of both the FES session and muscle contraction/relaxation ratio were progressively increased as performance improved. The experimental group showed significant improvements in arm function, electromyographic activity of the posterior deltoid, range of motion, and reduction in subluxation (as indicated by x-ray) compared with the control group. We concluded that the FES program was effective in reducing the severity of shoulder subluxation and pain, and possibly facilitating recovery of arm function.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of resistance training (RT) with inter-set static stretching (IS) versus traditional RT (TRT) on morphofunctional outcomes in recreationally resistance-trained male and female. Methods: Twenty-two recreationally-trained subjects were allocated to IS group (n = 12) or TRT (n = 10) and completed eight weeks of RT. The only difference between the groups was that IS group included static stretching between sets, while the TRT rested between the sets. Ultrasound images, dynamic and isometric strength tests for the elbow flexors and elbow extensors were evaluated pre- and post-intervention period. Results: Total training volume (TTV) was greater in TRT than IS (p = .031). TRT and IS caused similar increases in maximal dynamic and isometric strength. Fascicle length of the brachialis increased following TRT (p = .033); muscle thickness and the pennation angle of the distal portion of the triceps brachii increased following IS (p = .035 and p = .007, respectively). There were no significant changes in thickness and architecture for biceps brachii in either group. There were no significant differences between groups for any muscle strength and morphology outcome. Conclusion: IS negatively affects TTV but does not affect muscle strength and architecture of recreationally resistance-trained male and female.",

Partial range of motion exercise is effective for facilitating muscle hypertrophy and function through sustained intramuscular hypoxia in young trained men. J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1286-1294, 2019-The acute response to and long-term effects of partial range of motion exercise (PRE) and full range of motion exercise (FRE) of elbow extensors were compared in young trained men. The PRE was expected to increase the intramuscular hypoxic environment, which was theorized to enhance muscular hypertrophy. Forty-four resistance-trained men were divided into 2 training groups, PRE (n = 22) or FRE (n = 22) group, and performed the PRE or FRE acute exercise protocol. The PRE (elbow range from 45° to 90°) and FRE (from 0° to 120°) acute protocols consisted of 3 sets of 8 repetitions, with an 8RM, and an equivalent workload. After the initial testing, the training program for each group, comprised 3 training sessions per week for 8 weeks, was started. The acute responses of area under the oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) curve, blood lactate concentration, and root mean square of electromyography were significantly higher both before and after PRE than FRE training. Long-term effects were produced by both PRE and FRE, with significant (p ≤ 0.05) increases in cross-sectional area (CSA) of triceps brachii and isometric strength. The CSA increased significantly greater after PRE (48.7 ± 14.5%) than after FRE (28.2 ± 10.9%). Furthermore, during the PRE program, a positive correlation was detected between the percent increase in CSA and area under the Oxy-Hb curves before and after 8-week exercise training (before 8-week exercise training: r = 0.59, after 8-week exercise training: r = 0.70, p < 0.01).

Interset stretching vs. traditional strength training: effects on muscle strength and size in untrained individuals. J Strength Cond Res 33(7S): S159-S166, 2019-This study compared the effects of 8 weeks of traditional strength training (TST) and interset stretching (ISS) combined with TST on muscular adaptations. Twenty-nine sedentary, healthy adults were randomly assigned to either the TST (n = 17; 28.0 ± 6.4 years) or ISS (n = 12; 26.8 ± 6.1 years) group. Both groups performed 6 strength exercises encompassing the whole body (bench press, elbow extension, seated rows, biceps curl, knee extension, and knee flexion) performing 4 sets of 8-12 repetition maximum (RM) with a 90-second rest between sets. However, the ISS group performed static passive stretching, at maximum amplitude, for 30 seconds between sets. Both groups performed training sessions twice a week on nonconsecutive days. Muscle strength (i.e., 1RM) and hypertrophy (i.e., muscle thickness [MT] by ultrasonography) were measured at pre-test and after 8 weeks of training. Both groups increased 1RM bench press (p ≤ 0.0001): ISS (23.4%, CIdiff: 4.3 kg-11.1 kg) and TST (22.2%, CIdiff: 5.2 kg-10.9 kg) and 1RM knee extension (p ≤ 0.0001): ISS (25.5%, CIdiff: 5.6 kg-15.0 kg) and TST (20.6%, CIdiff: 4.4 kg-12.3 kg). Both groups increased MT of biceps brachii (BIMT), triceps brachii (TRMT), and rectus femoris (RFMT) (p ≤ 0.0001). BIMT: ISS (7.2%, CIdiff: 1.14-3.5 mm) and TST (4.7%, CIdiff: 0.5-2.5 mm), TRMT: ISS (12.3%, CIdiff: 1.1-4.4 mm) and TST (7.1%, CIdiff: 0.3-3.1 mm), and RFMT: ISS (12.4%, CIdiff: 1.1-2.9 mm) and TST (9.1%, CIdiff: 0.7-2.2 mm). For vastus lateralis muscle thickness (VLMT) and sum of the 4 muscle thickness sites (ΣMT), there was a significant group by time interaction (p ≤ 0.02) in which ISS increased VLMT and ΣMT to a greater extent than TST. Vastus lateralis muscle thickness: ISS (17.0%, CIdiff: 1.5-3.1 mm) and TST (7.3%, CIdiff: 0.7-2.1 mm), and ΣMT: ISS (10.5%, CIdiff: 6.5-9.0 mm) and TST (6.7%, CIdiff: 3.9-8.3 mm). Although our findings might suggest a benefit of adding ISS into TST for optimizing muscle hypertrophy, our data are not sufficient enough to conclude that ISS is superior to TST for inducing muscle hypertrophic adaptations. More studies are warranted to elucidate the effects of ISS compared with TST protocols on skeletal muscle. However, our findings support that adding ISS to regular TST regimens does not compromise muscular adaptations during the early phase of training (<8 weeks) in untrained individuals.",

In previous study, suppression of tremor by sensory electrical stimulation was confirmed on the index finger. This study investigates the effect of sensory stimulation on multiple segments and joints of the upper limb. It denotes the observation regarding the effect's continuity after halting the stimulation. 18 patients with essential tremor (8 men and 10 women) participated in this study. The task, \"arms stretched forward\", was performed and sensory electrical stimulation was applied on four muscles of the upper limb (Flexor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Radialis, Biceps Brachii, and Triceps Brachii) for 15 seconds. Three 3-D gyro sensors were used to measure the angular velocities of segments (finger, hand, and forearm) and joints (metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints) for three phases of pre-stimulation (Pre), during-stimulation (On), and 5 minute post-stimulation (P5). Three characteristic variables of root-mean-squared angular velocity, peak power, and peak power frequency were derived from the vector sum of the sensor signals. At On phase, RMS velocity was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints while peak power was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints except for forearm segment. Sensory stimulation showed no effect on peak power frequency. All variables at P5 were similar to those at On at all segments and joints. The decrease of peak power of the index finger was noted by 90% during stimulation from that of On phase, which was maintained even after 5 min. The results indicate that sensory stimulation may be an effective clinical method to treat the essential tremor.",

          "abstract": "Neural coupling of proximal and distal upper limb segments may have functional implications in the recovery of hemiparesis after stroke. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the stretch reflex response magnitude of spastic finger flexor muscles poststroke is influenced by sensory input from the shoulder and the elbow and whether reflex coupling of muscles throughout the upper limb is altered in spastic stroke survivors. Through imposed extension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, stretch of the relaxed finger flexors of the four fingers was imposed in 10 relaxed stroke subjects under different conditions of proximal sensory input, namely static arm posture (3 different shoulder/elbow postures) and electrical stimulation (surface stimulation of biceps brachii or triceps brachii, or none). Fast (300 degrees/s) imposed stretch elicited stretch reflex flexion torque at the MCP joints and reflex electromyographic (EMG) activity in flexor digitorum superficialis. Both measures were greatest in an arm posture of 90 degrees of elbow flexion and neutral shoulder position. Biceps stimulation resulted in greater MCP stretch reflex flexion torque. Fast imposed stretch also elicited reflex EMG activity in nonstretched heteronymous upper limb muscles, both proximal and distal. These results suggest that in the spastic hemiparetic upper limb poststroke, sensorimotor coupling of proximal and distal upper limb segments is involved in both the increased stretch reflex response of the finger flexors and an increased reflex coupling of heteronymous muscles. Both phenomena may be mediated through changes poststroke in the spinal reflex circuits and/or in the descending influence of supraspinal pathways.",

Muscle biopsies were obtained from triceps brachii 3 days before and 7 days after training. For estimating gene expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), mechano growth factor (MGF), MyoD and myogenin, real-time RT-PCR was performed.In group A, there was an increase in the 1 repeat maximum (1RM), but no change in V(max) (maximum movement velocity) and an increase in MHC (myosin heavy chain) IIa and a decrease in MHC IIx; in group B both 1RM and V(max) increased significantly along with an increase in MHC IIa and a decrease in MHC I. The MGF gene expression increased significantly in both groups (by 1160% and 59%, respectively), and IGF-1 increased only in group A (by 335%). MyoD and myogenin gene expression increased in group A (by 107% and 94%, respectively) but did not change in group B.Response of growth and myogenic factors occurs during muscular adaptation to a prolonged training, and strength training with different strategies caused different responses with respect to gene expression of these factors. These results suggest that SC activation is involved in the muscular adaptation process to training and might be attributed to MHC isoform transition.",

          "abstract": "In addition to its size and the extent of its neural activation, a muscle's geometry (the angles and lengths of its fibres or fascicles) strongly influences its force production characteristics. As with many other tissues within the body, muscle displays significant plasticity in its geometry. This review summarises geometric differences between various athlete populations and describes research examining the plasticity of muscle geometry with physical training, immobilisation/detraining, growth and aging. Typically, heavy resistance training in young adults has been shown to cause significant increases in fascicle angle of vastus lateralis and triceps brachii as measured by ultrasonography, while high-speed/plyometrics training in the absence of weight training has been associated with increases in fascicle length and a reduction in angles of vastus lateralis fascicles. These changes indicate that differences in geometry between various athletic populations might be at least partly attributable to their differing training regimes. Despite some inter-muscular differences, detraining/unloading is associated with decreases in fascicle angle, although little change was shown in muscles such as vastus lateralis and triceps brachii in studies examining the effects of prolonged bed rest. No research has examined the effects of other interventions such as endurance or chronic stretching training. Few data exist describing geometric adaptation during growth and maturation, although increases in gastrocnemius fascicle angle and length seem to occur until maturation in late adolescence. Although some evidence suggests that a decrease in both fascicle angle and length accompanies the normal aging process, there is a paucity of data examining the issue; heavy weight training might attenuate the decline, at least in fascicle length. A significant research effort is required to more fully understand geometric adaptation in response to physical training, immobilisation/detraining, growth and aging.",

Therefore, it is necessary to stretch the BBL and BBS separately. This study aimed to determine the positions where the BBL and BBS were most stretched, using shear wave elastography (SWE). Fifteen healthy young males participated in the study. The shear elastic moduli of the BBL and BBS of the non-dominant arm were measured using SWE. The measurement positions were the resting position (shoulder flexion and abduction 0°) and four stretching positions.. The elbow was extended, and the forearm was pronated in all positions. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test to compare the shear elastic moduli between the resting and stretched limb positions. In addition, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used to compare shear elastic moduli between the stretching positions that were significantly different compared to the resting position.. Results show that for BBL and BBS, shear elastic moduli were significantly higher in the shoulder extension + external rotation and shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation positions than in the resting position. Moreover, the shear elastic modulus of the BBL was significantly higher in shoulder extension + external rotation than in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation. In contrast, the shear elastic modulus of the BBS was significantly higher in shoulder horizontal abduction + internal rotation than in shoulder extension + external rotation.

This paper describes an ergonomic intervention to reduce lateral epicondylitis in the workstation of a textile logistics center. The intervention includes workplace-based exercise programs, evaluation of risk factors, and movement correction. An injury- and subject-specific score was calculated from the motion captured with wearable inertial sensors at the workplace to evaluate the risk factors of 93 workers. Then, a new working movement was adapted to the workplace, which limited the observed risk factors and took into account the subject-specific physical abilities. The movement was taught to the workers during personalized sessions. The risk factors of 27 workers were evaluated again after the intervention to validate the effectiveness of the movement correction. In addition, active warm-up and stretching programs were introduced as part of the workday to promote muscle endurance and improve resistance to repetitive stress. The present strategy offered good results at low cost, without any physical modification of the workplace and without any detriment to productivity.",

Prior trails for improving upper extremity functions after stroke have underestimated the role of gravitational force in motor planning and execution.The aims this trial were to study the effect of gravity as a facilitator for elbow extension and to estimate the immediate and retention effects of task specific training of elbow extensors on upper extremity function after stroke.Twenty-six right handed patients with first ever stroke represented the sample of the study. The participants were randomly assigned into two equal groups. The study group received treatment through two phases. Phase one included training for the elbow extensors in an antigravity position. Phase two included a set of task specific exercise for 16 weeks. The control group received traditional passive stretch and range of motion exercises. Manual dexterity and upper limb function were assessed by Nine-Hole Peg Test and Fugl-Meyer upper extremity. Goniometry was used for measuring elbow extension and forearm supination active ranges of motion.Significant improvements were observed in Nine-Hole Peg Test, Fugl-Meyer upper extremity, and ranges of motion at postintervention and follow-up compared to preintervention at P≤0.05.The results of this study provide an evidence that antigravity positions can be used as a centrally presented facilitator of elbow extension.

          "abstract": "Pain sensitization is a contributing factor to conditions of chronic pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of pain sensitization on the prognosis of lateral epicondylitis (LE) treated by self-stretching exercises and the use of a counterforce brace.We enrolled 131 patients who presented with isolated LE symptoms for less than 6 months. We initially measured pain sensitization by assessing patients' pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) in the contralateral middorsal forearm and administering a pain sensitization questionnaire (PSQ). For outcome assessments, we assessed the self-administered, patient-reported Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire at 6 and 12 months' follow-up.Initial PSQ scores correlated moderately with baseline DASH scores and slightly with symptom duration; PPTs correlated slightly with baseline DASH scores. After we accounted for confounding variables, patient-reported disability was associated with lower PPTs, higher PSQ scores, and manual labor at 6 months. These 3 factors accounted for 36% of variance in the DASH scores; however, at 12 months only the PSQ score was associated with higher DASH scores, accounting for 14% of variance.Pain sensitization during the early stages of LE correlated with initial symptom severity and duration and was associated with persistently increasing disability after 1 year of nonsurgical treatment. More research is needed to show whether early identification and treatment of pain sensitization will enhance LE treatment outcomes.Prognostic IV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

          "abstract": "To confirm the existence of epimuscular myofascial force transmission in humans, this study examined if manipulating joint angle to stretch the muscle can alter the shear modulus of a resting adjacent muscle, and whether there are regional differences in this response. The biceps brachii (BB: manipulated muscle) and the brachialis (BRA: resting adjacent muscle) were deemed suitable for this study because they are neighboring, yet have independent tendons that insert onto different bones. In order to manipulate the muscle length of BB only, the forearm was passively set at supination, neutral, and pronation positions. For thirteen healthy young adult men, the shear modulus of BB and BRA was measured with shear-wave elastography at proximal and distal muscle regions for each forearm position and with the elbow joint angle at either 100° or 160°. At both muscle regions and both elbow positions, BB shear modulus increased as the forearm was rotated from a supinated to pronated position. Conversely, BRA shear modulus decreased as function of forearm position. The effect of forearm position on shear modulus was most pronounced in the distal muscle region when the elbow was at 160°. The observed alteration of shear modulus of the resting adjacent muscle indicates that epimuscular myofascial force transmission is present in the human upper limb. Consistent with this assertion, we found that the effect of muscle length on shear modulus in both muscles was region-dependent.

          "abstract": "Essential tremor is an involuntary trembling of body limbs in people without tremor-related disease. In previous study, suppression of tremor by sensory electrical stimulation was confirmed on the index finger. This study investigates the effect of sensory stimulation on multiple segments and joints of the upper limb. It denotes the observation regarding the effect's continuity after halting the stimulation. 18 patients with essential tremor (8 men and 10 women) participated in this study. The task, \"arms stretched forward\", was performed and sensory electrical stimulation was applied on four muscles of the upper limb (Flexor Carpi Radialis, Extensor Carpi Radialis, Biceps Brachii, and Triceps Brachii) for 15 seconds. Three 3-D gyro sensors were used to measure the angular velocities of segments (finger, hand, and forearm) and joints (metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints) for three phases of pre-stimulation (Pre), during-stimulation (On), and 5 minute post-stimulation (P5). Three characteristic variables of root-mean-squared angular velocity, peak power, and peak power frequency were derived from the vector sum of the sensor signals. At On phase, RMS velocity was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints while peak power was reduced from Pre in all segments and joints except for forearm segment. Sensory stimulation showed no effect on peak power frequency. All variables at P5 were similar to those at On at all segments and joints. The decrease of peak power of the index finger was noted by 90% during stimulation from that of On phase, which was maintained even after 5 min. The results indicate that sensory stimulation may be an effective clinical method to treat the essential tremor.",

Simultaneous stretching of the fingers in addition to the wrist flexion has also been applied. However, the mechanism of this simultaneous stretching has not been clarified. This study is designed to clarify the mechanism underlying this simultaneous stretching technique based on the anatomical features of the origins of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and extensor digitorum communis (EDC).Thirty-nine arms from formalin-embalmed Japanese human specimens were dissected. The features of the origins of the ECRB and EDC were macroscopically observed, and the locations of each origin on the lateral epicondyle were measured.The ECRB had a long and wide, purely tendinous origin which originated from the anterior slope of the lateral epicondyle. The tendinous origin of the index finger of the EDC (EDC-IF) arose from the posterior aspect of the ECRB tendinous origin, with a coexisting muscular portion observed at the level of the proximal forearm. The middle finger of the EDC (EDC-MF) had a short tendinous origin with an associated muscular portion and originated proximo-laterally to the origin of the ECRB on the lateral epicondyle. In addition, the muscular origin of the EDC-MF arose on the superficial and posterior aspect of the ECRB tendinous origin. In contrast, the ring and little fingers of the EDC originated from the tendinous septum of the extensor digiti minimi and extensor carpi ulnaris, and had no connection with the ECRB tendinous origin.On the basis of our anatomical findings, simultaneous stretching of the wrist extensors by wrist, index and middle fingers flexion could provide stretching force to both the tendinous origins of the ECRB and EDC through the EDC-IF and EDC-MF.",

          "abstract": "Gripping force is produced by co-contraction of forearm flexors and extensors. Activation of extensors is important for stabilizing the wrist during gripping. However, forearm muscle function is complicated and the neurophysiological mechanism responsible for the gain in gripping force is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether increasing forearm extensor activation with isometric wrist extension training has an effect on gripping force. Thirteen healthy subjects participated in this study. Maximal voluntary contraction of gripping was measured using a piezosensor (MVC(grip)) and EMG of forearm muscles at every wrist angle (from 70° flexion to 80° extension with 10° intervals) were measured simultaneously at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after training. Training consisted of 30 repetitions equal to 70% MVC of isometric wrist extension for 8 weeks (5/week) on the right side. Gripping force was measured on both sides using a grip dynamometer without wrist angle restriction. Gripping force, EMG, maximal wrist extension force, and wrist angle-gripping force curve were investigated after training. After training, maximal wrist extension force increased significantly. Gripping force on the trained side also increased significantly. The training changed wrist angle at peak of MVC(grip). EMG activation of forearm extensors increased and that of flexors decreased during gripping. These results suggest that wrist extension training leads to an increase in gripping force and changes the balance of EMG activation between forearm flexors and extensors during gripping. Therefore, this training method should be useful as a therapeutic strategy for increasing grip strength.",

Ninety-four subjects (50 men) with chronic lateral epicondylitis were allocated randomly into three groups: stretching, concentric strengthening with stretching, and eccentric strengthening with stretching. Subjects performed an exercise program for six weeks. All three groups received instruction on icing, stretching, and avoidance of aggravating activities. The strengthening groups received instruction on isolated concentric and eccentric wrist extensor strengthening, respectively. At six weeks, significant gains were made in all three groups as assessed with pain-free grip strength, Patient-rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire, Short Form 36, and visual analog pain scale. No significant differences in outcome measures were noted among the three groups. Although there were no significant differences in outcome among the groups, eccentric strengthening did not cause subjects to worsen. Further studies are needed to assess the unique effects of a more intense or longer eccentric strengthening program for patients with lateral epicondylitis.",

          "abstract": "Eccentric activities are an important component of physical conditioning and everyday activities. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) can result from strenuous eccentric tasks and can be a limiting factor in motor performance for several days after exercise. An efficacious method of treatment for DOMS would enhance athletic performance and hasten the return to activities of daily living. The purpose of this study was to identify a treatment method which could assist in the recovery of DOMS. In the selection of treatment methods, emphasis was directed toward treatments that could be rendered independently by an individual, therefore making the treatment valuable to an athletic trainer in team setting. DOMS was induced in 70 untrained volunteers via 15 sets of 15 eccentric contractions of the forearm extensor muscles on a Lido isokinetic dynamometer. All subjects performed a pilot exercise bout for a minimum of 9 weeks before data collection to assure that DOMS would be produced. Data were collected on 15 dependent variables: active and passive wrist flexion and extension, forearm girth, limb volume, visual analogue pain scale, muscle soreness index, isometric strength, concentric and eccentric wrist total work, concentric and eccentric angle of peak torque. Data were collected on six occasions: pre- and post-induced DOMS, 20 minutes after treatment, and 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 7 groups (6 treatment and 1 control). Treatments included a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, high velocity concentric muscle contractions on an upper extremity ergometer, ice massage, 10-minute static stretching, topical Amica montana ointment, and sublingual A. montana pellets. A 7 x 6 ANOVA with repeated measures on time was performed on the delta values of each of the 15 dependent variables. Significant main effects (p < .05) were found for all of the dependent variables on time only. There were no significant differences between treatments. Therefore, we conclude that none of the treatments were effective in abating the signs and symptoms of DOMS. In fact, the NSAID and A. montana treatments appeared to impede recovery of muscle function.",

          "abstract": "Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60-90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001).

Twenty-four healthy males (mean age: 23.08 ± 0.97 years; height: 172.42 ± 4.61 cm; weight: 66.38 ± 6.68 kg; and body mass index: 22.30 ± 1.81 kg/m2), randomly divided into four groups: stretching relaxation group (ST, n = 6), mechanical vibration massage (MV, n = 6), pulse massage (PU, n = 6), and control (CO, n = 6). Measurements using the Myoton digital muscle assessment system were conducted daily over 2 weeks. The experimental groups demonstrated a notable decrease in tension and stiffness, accompanied by heightened elasticity in the upper trapezius muscles. Conversely, the control group exhibited contrasting trends. Although no significant variances were detected among the relaxation techniques, all proved efficacious compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, relaxation of the upper trapezius muscles significantly influenced the middle trapezius muscles (P < 0.05). Various relaxation methods positively influenced trapezius muscle attributes over 2 weeks, with inter-regional effects noted.Copyright © 2024 Copyright: © 2024 Journal of Physiological Investigation.",

          "abstract": "Round-shoulder posture (RSP) is a common postural condition, characterized by protraction, downward rotation, anterior tilting and internal rotation of the scapula. RSP can lead to shoulder dysfunction. Different methods have been proposed for rehabilitating and correcting the altered posture in RSP including stretching, strengthening exercises, and shoulder brace or taping. However, the findings are controversial and studies are ongoing to develop more effective method. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of scapular posterior tilting (SPT) exercise in different support positions on scapular muscle activities in men and women with RSP. In a prospective observational clinical study, we assessed demographic, basic clinical parameters and study variables of the subjects with RSP (n = 20) (men/women = 9/11) attending Daegu University in Gyeongsan, South Korea. To do so, we compared electromyographic (EMG) activities of lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles between men and women with RSP during SPT exercise on four different support surfaces to determine any difference in the EMG activities. The results revealed that women showed significant differences in EMG activities in the lower and left upper trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, while men showed significant differences in EMG activity only in the lower trapezius muscle during SPT exercise on four different surfaces (P 0.0125).© 2024.

          "abstract": "Rounded shoulder posture (RSP) causes shoulder pain and can lead to shoulder impingement and thoracic outlet syndromes, ultimately resulting in a frozen shoulder. Altered scapular positions in RSP patients affect muscle activity. Many studies have explored methods to correct and prevent RSP, including shoulder braces, muscle strengthening, stretching, and inhibition techniques. Using a shoulder brace reduces RSP and improves shoulder discomfort and function, similar to conventional rehabilitation. However, despite their effectiveness, these braces are bulky and inconvenient, which makes continuous daily wear challenging. This is especially true for women who are sensitive to their appearance. To address this issue, methods have been developed to convert women's underwear bra straps into braces. This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of three underwear-mounted rounded shoulder braces and to identify the brace that is most effective in decreasing RSP and upper trapezius (UT) muscle activity and increasing lower trapezius (LT) muscle activity in patients with RSP. The study included 18 patients with an RSP. The RSP amount and UT and LT muscle activities were measured before and after three interventions. The interventions were scapular posterior tilting (SPT) exercises with the X strap, X + 8 strap, and inner brace. Compared with the baseline value, the RSP amount was significantly lower with the three braces. The RSP was significantly lower with the X + 8 strap and the inner brace than with the X strap. The inner brace showed significantly lower UT muscle activity than those with the X strap and X + 8 straps and significantly greater LT muscle activity than that with the X + 8 strap. These results show underwear-mounted braces as a potential RSP solution, but long-term sustainability and improving comfort, especially for those concerned about appearance, require further research and development.",

          "abstract": "Traditional Thai massage (TTM) is a unique form of whole body massage practiced to promote health and well-being in Thailand since ancient times. The goal of the present study was to create a standardised TTM protocol to treat office syndrome (OS) diagnosed based on the identification of the palpation of at least one so-called myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in the upper trapezius muscle. The new 90 min TTM protocol, which was developed following appropriate review of the literature and in consultation with relevant experts, has 25 distinct steps (20 pressing steps, 2 artery occlusion steps, and 3 stretching steps). Eleven TTM therapists treated three patients each using the new 90 min TTM protocol. All of the therapists reported scores greater than 80% in respect to their satisfaction and confidence to deliver the protocol, and all of the patients gave the treatment a satisfaction score of greater than 80%. The treatment produced a significant reduction in pain intensity measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 10 cm, of 2.33 cm (95% CI (1.76, 2.89 cm), p < 0.001) and significant increase in pain pressure threshold (PPT) of 0.37 kg/cm2 (95% CI (0.10, 0.64 kg/cm2), p < 0.05). The protocol was revised based on the feedback and the results obtained, and the new standardised TTM protocol will be applied in a randomised control trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of TTM and conventional physical therapy (PT) for treating OS.",

          "title": "The Effect of Reciprocal Inhibition Techniques on Pain, Range of Motion, and Functional Activities in Patients With Upper Trapezitis.",
          "abstract": "Background and objective Upper trapezius can cause neck pain, and restrict functional activities and cervical range of motion (ROM), and hence its management should be part of a global rehabilitation program. Owing to the heterogeneity of the existing trials, various techniques of manual physical therapy might be potent, though the scope of their efficacy is currently unspecified. The reciprocal inhibition technique of the muscle energy technique (MET) works on both agonist as well antagonist muscles for the reduction of pain and to improve overall functional activities. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the reciprocal inhibition technique of MET on pain, cervical ROM, and functional activities in patients with upper trapezitis. Methods An interventional cross-sectional study involving 30 patients with neck pain due to upper trapezitis was conducted. The outcome measures were as follows: numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) score for pain intensity, universal goniometer for cervical ROM, and neck disability index (NDI) score for functional activities. The reciprocal inhibition technique involved a five-second hold, five-second rest, followed by stretching with a 10-60-second hold, with five repetitions. Patients were treated for five sessions a week for two weeks. Results Paired t-test was used to compare the group's mean values before and after therapy. Our findings revealed that NPRS score, cervical ROM, and NDI score notably improved (p=0.001). Conclusion The reciprocal inhibition technique of MET in patients with upper trapezitis showed significant improvement in neck pain, cervical movement, and functional activities. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate our findings.Copyright © 2023, Jawade et al.",

And, despite the pathophysiology demonstrating the relationship between migraine and the cervical spine, the effectiveness of craniocervical exercises in these patients has not been verified. So, the aimed of this study was verify the effectiveness of craniocervical muscle-strengthening exercise (CMSE) in reducing the frequency and intensity of headache in migraine patients. METHODS: A two-armed, parallel-group randomized controlled trial with a 3-month follow-up was performed. For eight weeks, the volunteers in the intervention group (n = 21) performed a protocol of CMSE, while those in the sham ultrasound group (n = 21) received the application of disconnected therapeutic ultrasound in the upper trapezius and guideline for home-stretching. The primary outcomes were the frequency and intensity of the headache. The secondary outcomes were questionnaires about migraine and neck disability, and satisfaction with the treatment, cervical range of motion, the pressure pain threshold, craniocervical flexion test (CCFT), cervical muscle strength and endurance test, and the cervical muscle activity during the physical tests.No differences were observed for the changes observed in primary outcomes after eight weeks and at the 3-months follow up (p > 0.05). For the secondary outcomes, craniocervical exercises improved the sensitivity of the frontal muscle (p = 0.040) and promoted a reduced amplitude of muscle activity of the anterior scalene and upper trapezius in the last stages of CCFT (p ≤ 0.010). There was also reduced muscle activity of the anterior scalene and splenius capitis in the endurance test (p ≤ 0.045), as evaluated by surface electromyography.CMSE were insufficient in reducing the frequency and intensity of headache, improving the performance of the cervical muscles, or reducing migraine and neck pain-related disabilities. This was found despite a decreased electromyographic activity of the cervical muscles during the last stages of CCFT and increased median frequency during the endurance test.Accession code RBR-8gfv5j , registered 28/11/2016 in the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC).© 2022.

Patients in both groups received the same stretching exercise program and drug regimen during the intervention.Pain and NDI scores in both groups were significantly improved at the end of the treatment and four weeks later. At the end of the treatment, the pain score was similar between the groups. Four weeks after the treatment, the pain score in the ECSWT group was significantly lower than in the phonophoresis group (P-value = 0.030). The NDI score was not significantly different between the groups at the end of the treatment. However, four weeks after the treatment, the NDI score was significantly lower in the ECSWT group than in the phonophoresis group (P-value=0.032). The trend of changes in the pain and NDI scores was not significantly different between the groups.Both phonophoresis and ECSWT groups effectively decreased pain and neck disability in patients with MPS, with the superiority of ECSWT with a more lasting effect for a month after the end of the treatment.Copyright © 2021, Author(s).",

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two different treatment programs: progressive resistance exercises plus manual therapy (PRE plus MT) and motor control exercises (MCE), on isometric strength of upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MTr), lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA), supraspinatus (Supr.), anterior deltoid (A.D), and latissimus dorsi (LD). 80 male university-level overhead athletes clinically diagnosed with SIS were randomly allocated into either of the two groups: PRE plus MT and MCE group. Athletes in the PRE plus MT group underwent graduated exercises with resistance elastic band, stretching exercises, and mobilization of the thoracic and shoulder joints. MCE group was submitted to motor control exercises in varied planar positions. Athletes in both groups underwent management 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Isometric strength of UT, MTr, LT, Supr, A.D, SA, and LD was measured at three-time points: baseline, 4th week, and 8th week. Relative to baseline, both interventions were found to be effective in increasing and optimizing the isometric strength of muscles (p 0.05). However, athletes in PRE plus MT group presented a more pronounced increase in isometric strength than those in the MCE group. Between groups analysis found the largest isometric strength improvement in PRE plus MT group for A.D, followed by Supr. and UT muscles (p < 0.05; effect size: 0.39 to 0.40). The study concluded that compared to MCE, PRE plus MT provides greater improvement in the isometric strength of scapulohumeral muscles.Copyright © 2021 Saurabh Sharma et al.",

          "abstract": "Granisetron and lidocaine injections have been used for the management of myofascial pain syndrome. This study was aimed to compare the efficacy of granisetron and lidocaine injections to trigger points of upper trapezius in the management of myofascial pain syndrome.We performed a double-blind randomized clinical trial in an outpatient clinic of physical medicine and rehabilitation at a teaching hospital. A total of 40 patients aged ≥18 with neck pain due to myofascial pain syndrome were included. They had pain for at least one month with the intensity of at least 30 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale. Each participant received a single dose of 1 mL lidocaine 2% or 1 mg (in 1 mL) granisetron. The solutions were injected into a maximum of three trigger points of the upper trapezius. We instructed all patients to remain active while avoiding strenuous activity for three or four days, and to perform stretch exercise and massage of their upper trapezius muscles. We assessed the patients before the interventions, and one month and three months post-injection. The primary outcome was the Neck Disability Index and the secondary outcome was the Neck Pain and Disability Scale.Both interventions were successful in reducing neck pain and disability (all p-values <0.001). However, the neck pain and disability responded more favorably to lidocaine than granisetron (p=0.001 for Neck Disability Index, and p=0.006 for Neck Pain and Disability Scale). No significant side-effect was recognized for both groups.Both lidocaine and granisetron injections to trigger points are effective and safe for the management of the syndrome and the benefits remain at least for three months. However, lidocaine is more effective in reducing pain and disability. The injections are well-tolerated, although a transient pain at the site of injections is a common complaint. One mL of lidocaine 2% is more effective than 1 mg (in 1 mL) granisetron for injecting into the trigger points of the upper trapezius in myofascial pain syndrome.© 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

The following seven trunk positions were chosen as the LD stretching positions; upright of the trunk (Baseline), flexion of the trunk (Flex), contralateral bending of the trunk (LB), contralateral rotation of the trunk (Rot), flexion and contralateral bending of the trunk (Flex + LB), flexion and contralateral rotation of the trunk (Flex + Rot), and contralateral bending and contralateral rotation of the trunk (LB + Rot). Maximal elevation of the upper limb was passively added to all positions. The shear elastic modulus, used as the index of muscle elongation, was measured at the four parts (upper, middle, lower, distal parts) of the LD. The shear elastic moduli showed obviously high values in Rot and LB + Rot at the upper, middle, and distal parts, and also in LB, Rot, and LB + Rot at the lower part. These findings suggest that contralateral trunk rotation, or a combination of contralateral trunk bending and rotation are effective trunk positions for stretching all parts of the LD.

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a six week exercise program to reduce the muscle tone of the trapezius and musculoskeletal discomfort (MED) of office workers. Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67).

          "abstract": "The pain in the trapezius muscle is known as trapezius myalgia. The patient often complains of trapezius muscle soreness and tightness. Muscle soreness usually lasts for a few days, if not longer. This muscular rigidity and stiffness cause spasms in upper trapezius fibres, culminating in neck discomfort in the posterior side of the neck and shoulder area. This protocol was designed to describe the study to evaluate the effect of myofascial release (MFR) versus high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief and functional improvement in subjects with trapezius myalgia. Methods: Forty-five subjects with trapezius myalgia meeting inclusion criteria were selected for the study. Two groups were created, with group A undergoing MFR therapy and group B undergoing high-frequency TENS. The procedure was completed within four weeks. Regular assessments were carried out in the first week and fourth week of the rehabilitation. Throughout the recovery process, we evaluated pain, functional improvement, and range of motion of the neck at regular intervals. The outcome measures taken were the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Discussion: The intervention's efficacy was assessed by looking at pain alleviation using the outcome measures. The study's findings strongly supported the application of these approaches and modalities in the rehabilitation of myalgia patients.Copyright © 2022, Joshi et al.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a six week exercise program to reduce the muscle tone of the trapezius and musculoskeletal discomfort (MED) of office workers. Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen's d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p = 0.003, ES = -0.60) and increased in the non-dominant middle trapezius (p = 0.016, ES = 0.45) after the exercise program, which eliminated significant muscle asymmetries. MED significantly decreased in the neck (p = 0.027, ES = -0.60) and upper back (p = 0.046, ES = -0.67). In conclusion, MED appears to improve in office workers after a six week training program, which may be explained by a decrease in trapezius tone and increase in the left middle trapezius tone.",

The understanding of mechanisms, including the peripheral balance between nociceptive and antinociceptive processes, is incomplete. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a class of endogenous compounds that regulate inflammation and pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of two NAEs: the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type-α ligand palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and stearoylethanolamide (SEA) in the muscle interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP randomized to two different neck specific training programs and in a healthy pain-free control group (CON).Fifty-seven women with CNSP were randomized to strength + stretch or stretch alone exercise programs. Twenty-nine subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months of exercise. Twenty-four CON subjects underwent microdialysis procedure before and after 4-6 months without any intervention in between. Microdialysate samples were collected from the trapezius muscle and analyzed by mass spectrometry for PEA and SEA levels.PEA and SEA levels were significantly higher in CNSP patients compared with CON. PEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after both training programs. SEA was significantly higher in CNSP than in CON after stretch alone but not after strength + stretch training. A significant positive correlation was found between changes in pain intensity and in SEA levels in the strength + stretch group, but not in the stretch alone group.Our results indicate that exercise interventions differentially affect the levels of the bioactive lipids PEA and SEA in the interstitium of the trapezius muscle in women with CNSP.Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
